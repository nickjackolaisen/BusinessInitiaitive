## Why You Need an S-Corporation

### 1. Tax Benefits
S-Corporations offer pass-through taxation, meaning business income, losses, deductions, and credits pass through to shareholders, avoiding double taxation.

### 2. Limited Liability Protection
An S-Corporation provides personal liability protection for its shareholders, safeguarding personal assets from business debts and legal claims.

### 3. Credibility and Perpetuity
Incorporating as an S-Corporation enhances business credibility and ensures the company can continue indefinitely, regardless of ownership changes.
