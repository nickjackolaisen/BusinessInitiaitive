<p>If you prefer to do it yourself, below is a simplified guide to help you through the process:</p>

<h3>1. Choose a Name for Your LLC</h3>
<p>Your LLC's name must be distinguishable from other business entities registered in New York. You can check name availability on the New York Secretary of State's website.</p>

<h3>2. Appoint a Registered Agent</h3>
<p>A registered agent is required for your LLC. This can be an individual or a business entity authorized to do business in New York.</p>

<p>In most places you can act as your company's registered agent, just know your information will be public record.<p>

<h3>3. File the Certificate of Formation</h3>
<p>Submit the Certificate of Formation to the New York Secretary of State. This can be done either online or by mail.</p>

<h3>4. Create an Operating Agreement</h3>
<p>Although not required by every state, operating agreements are recommended in New York to outline the management structure and operating procedures of your LLC.</p>

<h3>5. Obtain an EIN</h3>
<p>Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This is necessary for tax purposes and to open a business bank account.</p>

<p><b>Without an EIN there is no corporate veil protecting your personal assets.</b></p>

<h3>6. Comply with Local Regulations</h3>
<p>Check with Seneca County Clerk's Office for any local permits or licenses that may be required for your business.</p>

<h3>7. File Annual Reports</h3>
<p>New York requires LLCs to file an annual report. Ensure you comply with this requirement to maintain good standing.</p>

Some states also require quarterly reports. So make sure to double check with the New York Secretary of State.
