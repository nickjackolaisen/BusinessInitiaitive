- question: "How do fixed and variable costs affect the break-even point?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Higher fixed and variable costs increase the number of units needed to break even."
  extended_answers:
    - "Fixed costs, like rent or salaries, don't change with production volume and thus require higher sales to cover."
    - "Variable costs, such as raw materials and labor, increase with each unit produced, affecting the contribution margin."
    - "Reducing either fixed or variable costs can lower the BEP, making it easier to achieve profitability sooner."

- question: "What is the difference between gross profit margin and break-even point?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Gross profit margin measures profitability, while BEP indicates the minimum sales required to cover costs."
  extended_answers:
    - "Gross profit margin is the ratio of gross profit to total revenue, showing how much profit is earned after deducting production costs."
