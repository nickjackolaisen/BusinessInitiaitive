- question: "What is price elasticity of demand?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded changes in response to price changes."
  extended_answers:
    - "Price elasticity of demand quantifies consumer responsiveness to price changes."
    - "If a product has a high elasticity, a small price increase will result in a significant drop in demand."
    - "Conversely, a low elasticity indicates that price changes have minimal effects on demand."
    - "For instance, luxury goods like designer handbags often have high elasticity, while essential products such as gasoline tend to have low elasticity."

- question: "How is price elasticity of demand calculated?"
  simple_answer:
    - "It is calculated using the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price."
  extended_answers:
    - "Price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated using the formula:"
    - "<b>PED</b> = (Change in Quantity / Average Quantity) / (Change in Price / Average Price)"
    - "This formula provides a numerical value that helps businesses understand the sensitivity of their customers to price changes."
    - "A PED value greater than 1 indicates high sensitivity, while a value below 1 signals inelastic demand."

- question: "Why should businesses consider price elasticity of demand when setting prices?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Understanding elasticity helps businesses maximize revenue by pricing their products strategically."
  extended_answers:
    - "By assessing the elasticity of their products, businesses can better forecast consumer behavior."
    - "For instance, a product with high elasticity should be priced more competitively to avoid losing customers due to price hikes, whereas a product with low elasticity can bear higher prices without significant losses in demand."
    - "This helps companies optimize pricing for profitability and competitiveness."

- question: "How does advertising impact price elasticity?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Effective advertising can reduce the elasticity of demand by increasing brand loyalty."
  extended_answers:
    - "Advertising creates a unique brand image, increasing perceived value and reducing consumers' sensitivity to price changes."
    - "Loyal customers will prioritize specific brands even if prices increase."
    - "For example, Apple products have lower price elasticity due to brand loyalty fostered through consistent advertising and high-quality standards."

- question: "What role does income play in price elasticity?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Changes in consumer income levels can alter the elasticity of demand for certain products."
  extended_answers:
    - "When consumer incomes rise, the demand for luxury goods becomes less sensitive to price changes (lower elasticity), while essential goods remain stable."
    - "In periods of economic downturns, demand for non-essential items with high elasticity drops sharply, reflecting reduced purchasing power."

- question: "How can businesses use price elasticity to improve their marketing strategy?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Businesses can tailor promotions and campaigns based on the price sensitivity of their customers."
  extended_answers:
    - "Understanding which products are highly elastic allows businesses to create more compelling marketing campaigns or discounts to stimulate demand."
    - "For example, a company might use time-sensitive discounts on products with high elasticity to drive immediate purchases, knowing customers respond strongly to price reductions."

- question: "How frequently should businesses review price elasticity?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Reviewing it annually or during significant market changes is advisable."
  extended_answers:
    - "Businesses should periodically assess price elasticity to adapt to changing market conditions, consumer behavior, and economic trends."
    - "For instance, a major competitor entering the market or significant economic shifts could significantly alter consumer demand, requiring a fresh analysis of price sensitivity."
