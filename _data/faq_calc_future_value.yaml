  extended_answers:
    - "The formula above assumes that you are making a one-time investment."
    - "However, if you plan to make regular contributions to your investment over time, you can use a more complex formula that takes this into account."
    - "For example, the formula for calculating future value with regular contributions is FV = PMT x [(1 + r)^n - 1 / r] x (1 + r), where PMT is the periodic payment made to the investment."

- question: "How can I use future value calculations in my financial planning?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Understanding future value calculations can help you make informed decisions about how to allocate your resources and invest your money."
    - "By estimating the future value of different investment opportunities, you can compare them and choose those that offer higher returns."
  extended_answers:
    - "For example, suppose you have $10,000 to invest today and plan to leave it untouched for 20 years."
    - "If you invest it in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 3%, it will grow to $18,061 after 20 years."
    - "However, if you invest it in a stock market index fund with an average annual return of 8%, it will grow to $46,610 after 20 years."
    - "This shows how understanding future value calculations can help you identify investments with higher potential returns."

- question: "What are some limitations of using future value calculations?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Future value calculations are estimates based on assumptions about interest rates and other factors that may change over time."
    - "They do not take into account unexpected events or changes in the market that may affect your investment."
  extended_answers:
    - "Additionally, future value calculations do not consider taxes or fees associated with investing."
    - "For example, if you invest in a mutual fund, you may have to pay management fees or other expenses that can reduce your returns."
    - "Therefore, it's important to use future value calculations as a starting point for your financial planning and to consider other factors that may affect your investments' real-world performance."
