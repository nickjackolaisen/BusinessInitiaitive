- question: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Simple interest is calculated only on the initial principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the initial principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods."
  extended_answers:
    - "The primary distinction between simple and compound interest lies in their calculation methods."
    - "With simple interest, you pay or earn a fixed percentage of the original loan or investment amount (principal) over time."
    - "In contrast, compound interest involves earning or paying interest not only on the principal but also on any previously earned or paid interest that has been added to the balance."
    - "For example, consider a $10,000 investment with an annual 5% return. With simple interest, you would earn $500 per year ($10,000 x 0.05), totaling $2,500 after five years."
    - "However, with compound interest compounded annually, your returns would increase each year as follows: Year 1: $10,500, Year 2: $11,025, Year 3: $11,576.25, ..., Year 5: $12,763."

- question: "How do central banks influence interest rates?"
  simple_answer:
    - "Central banks influence interest rates by adjusting their key policy rate and implementing monetary policies such as open market operations and quantitative easing."
  extended_answers:
    - "Central banks play a critical role in managing a country's economy by setting short-term benchmark rates that commercial banks use as a reference for determining their lending rates."
    - "For example, when a central bank lowers its key policy rate (e.g., Federal Funds Rate in the US), commercial banks typically follow suit by lowering their lending ratesâ€”making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers."
    - "Additionally, central banks can utilize monetary tools like open market operations (buying/selling government bonds) to regulate the money supply and affect interest rates."
    - "When a central bank buys government bonds, it injects money into the financial system, increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates."
    - "Conversely, selling government bonds removes money from the system, reducing the money supply and raising interest rates."
