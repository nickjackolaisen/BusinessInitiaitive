Hello, my name is Jack. 
<p>
I started <a href="https://www.businessinitiative.org/"> Business Initiative</a> in 2020 (Formerly llcpalace.com). This came after I had wanted to start my own LLC for a clothing business and was disappointed in how complicated and unclear the information was online about limited liabilty companies. 
</p>
<p>Since then I have spent the last 4 years researching everything there is to know about this business structure and other types of businesses. I have dug through all of the mess of information and am presenting it in the most clear and organized way to help others in their entrepreneurial journies. 
</p>
<p>
Here is a little bit about my background and a few of my experiences:
</p>
<p>
I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout from Troop 236. <a href="https://www.miamitownship.com/DocumentCenter/View/912/Eagle-Scout-Nicholaisen?bidId="> Here is my Eagle Project</a>
</p>
<p>
I spent a year abroad as a foreign-exchange student in Ussel France. <a href="https://www.lamontagne.fr/ussel-19200/actualites/apres-une-annee-scolaire-passee-a-ussel-jack-nicholaisen-retourne-chez-lui-dans-lohio_12446095/">Here's the time I was on the front page of the regional newspaper</a>
</p>
<p>
Attended Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) and rowed on the <a href="https://msoeraiders.com/sports/mens-rowing/roster/jack-nicholaisen/2585">Raiders Varsity Crew Team</a>
</p>
<p>
I am learning in Jerusalem, Israel at Yeshiva Aish HaTorah. When I am not working on Business Initiative I am learning Jewish Law. I guess that's what piqued my interest in learning about business law and trying to simplify all of the complicated rules and terminology. I must say it's a lot easier in English than it is in 2000 year old Aramaic.
