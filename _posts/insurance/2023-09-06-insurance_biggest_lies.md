The insurance industry is a massive, complex, and often confusing landscape for consumers. 

In the pursuit of gaining new customers, many insurance companies have resorted to using misleading or downright false advertising claims.

{% include takeaway-box.html bullet1="<b>False savings claims:</b> Be cautious of exaggerated savings promises in ads, as actual savings may vary significantly based on individual circumstances." bullet2="<b>Misleading rate comparisons:</b> Insurance companies often cherry-pick data to make their rates seem more competitive; always compare multiple quotes from different providers." bullet3="<b>Overhyped coverage benefits:</b> Some ads may overstate the extent of coverage offered; carefully review policy details and exclusions before purchasing." bullet4="<b>Bundling misconceptions:</b> While bundling insurance policies can lead to discounts, it doesn't guarantee the best overall value or coverage; evaluate each policy individually." bullet5="<b>Omission of hidden fees:</b> Ads may not disclose additional costs like deductibles or surcharges; ask for a clear breakdown of all charges before signing up for a policy."%}

In this article, we will dissect some of the biggest lies found in new insurance industry ads and provide accurate information to help you make informed decisions.

## 1. "Save up to 15% on car insurance!"

### The truth: Your savings may vary

Insurance companies love to tout the savings they can offer customers, but these savings are not guaranteed. 

In reality, the savings you receive will depend on a variety of factors, such as your driving record, location, and the type of coverage you choose. 

It's essential to shop around and compare quotes from multiple providers to ensure you're getting the best deal.

-   A study by the [Texas Department of Insurance](https://www.helpinsure.com/auto/index.html?intid=hi-auto) found that consumers who compared rates saved an average of 38% on their car insurance premiums.
-   [A Consumer Reports survey](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/auto-insurance-special-report/index.htm) found that 71% of respondents who switched car insurers in the past five years saved money.

## 2. "No medical exam required for life insurance!"

### The truth: Limited coverage and higher premiums

While it's true that some life insurance policies don't require a medical exam, these policies generally offer lower coverage amounts and come with higher premiums. 

Insurers take on a higher risk by not requiring an exam, so they compensate by charging more for these policies. 

If you're in good health, it's worth considering a policy that requires a medical exam for better coverage and lower premiums.

-   [No-exam life insurance policies](https://www.policygenius.com/life-insurance/no-medical-exam-life-insurance/) typically offer coverage amounts between \$50,000 and \$500,000, whereas policies that require an exam can offer coverage of \$1 million or more.
-   Premiums for [no-exam policies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/life-insurance/no-exam-life-insurance/) can be up to 20% higher than those for policies requiring a medical exam.

## 3. "Bundle your insurance and save!"

### The truth: Bundling isn't always the best option

Bundling multiple insurance policies (e.g., home and auto) with the same provider can lead to some savings. 

However, it's not always the best option for everyone. Depending on your unique circumstances, you might find better deals by getting separate policies from different providers. 

Always compare the costs of bundled and separate policies to determine which option is best for you.

-   [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2019041%20U.S.%20Insurance%20Shopping%20Study.pdf) found that customers who bundle their home and auto insurance save an average of \$235 per year.
-   However, [a report by Forbes Advisor](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/homeowners-insurance/bundling-insurance/) found that bundling isn't always the best option, as only 58% of bundled customers saved money compared to purchasing separate policies.

## 4. "Lower your deductible for a small increase in premium!"

### The truth: Higher premiums may not be worth the trade-off

A lower deductible might seem like an attractive option, as it reduces your out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim. However, this often comes at the cost of higher premiums. 

It's crucial to weigh the potential savings from a lower deductible against the increased premiums you'll pay over the life of your policy. 

In many cases, choosing a higher deductible with lower premiums can save you more in the long run.

-   [A study by CarInsurance.com](https://www.carinsurance.com/calculators/how-much-can-you-save-by-raising-deductible.aspx) found that increasing your deductible from \$500 to \$1,000 could save you an average of 9% on your premium, while raising it to \$2,000 could save you an average of 16%.

## 5. "Guaranteed acceptance for all applicants!"

### The truth: Limited coverage and exclusions may apply

Guaranteed acceptance policies can be appealing, especially for those who have been denied coverage in the past. 

However, these policies often come with limited coverage, higher premiums, and specific exclusions. 

Before signing up for a guaranteed acceptance policy, it's essential to carefully review the terms and conditions to ensure you're getting adequate coverage.

-   [Guaranteed issue life insurance policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guaranteed-issue-life-insurance.asp) typically have a graded death benefit, which means the full payout is not available until the policy has been in force for a certain number of years (usually two or three).

## 6. "Switching insurance providers is a hassle!"

### The truth: It's easier than you think

Many insurance companies try to scare consumers into staying with their current provider by claiming that switching is a complicated and time-consuming process. 

In reality, switching insurance providers can be relatively straightforward and even save you money. 

Don't let fear of the unknown keep you from exploring better options for your insurance needs.

-   A report by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2018%20Consumer%20Insurance%20Survey.pdf) found that 44% of consumers switched insurance providers within the past four years, indicating that switching providers is not as difficult as some may believe.

## 7. "Accident forgiveness for all customers!"

### The truth: Restrictions and eligibility requirements apply

While accident forgiveness may be advertised as a standard feature, it's often only available to specific customers who meet certain criteria. 

These can include maintaining a clean driving record for a set number of years or being enrolled in higher-tier insurance plans. 

It's important to review your policy and understand the exact conditions required to qualify for accident forgiveness.

-   [A study by The Zebra](https://www.thezebra.com/auto-insurance/coverage/accident-forgiveness/) found that about 96% of drivers who had accident forgiveness on their auto insurance policies had not been in an at-fault accident within the past seven years.

## 8. "New car replacement coverage at no extra cost!"

### The truth: Limited availability and additional costs may apply

While new car replacement coverage can be an attractive feature, it's not always offered at no extra cost. 

Some insurers may charge additional premiums for this coverage, while others may require you to purchase comprehensive and collision coverage first. 

Be sure to read the fine print and fully understand the conditions and costs associated with new car replacement before signing up.

-   According to [a study by Insure.com](https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/new-car-replacement.html), new car replacement coverage can add between 2% and 5% to your annual premium, depending on your insurer.

## 9. "Get a discount just for being a safe driver!"

### The truth: Usage-based programs and monitoring may be required

While safe driver discounts are indeed offered by many insurers, they often require enrollment in usage-based insurance programs that monitor your driving habits. 

These programs may use telematics devices or smartphone apps to track data such as speed, braking, and mileage. 

If you're uncomfortable with this level of monitoring, these discounts may not be the best fit for you.

-   A report by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/UBI%20Consumer%20Shopping%20Tool.pdf) found that 70% of consumers are willing to let insurers monitor their driving in exchange for discounts on auto insurance premiums.

## 10. "Roadside assistance is included with every policy!"

### The truth: Optional add-on or separate membership required

Some insurers may advertise roadside assistance as an included benefit when it's actually an optional add-on service or requires a separate membership. 

Roadside assistance coverage can vary greatly among providers and may have limitations on service calls or distance. 

Make sure to understand the terms and costs associated with roadside assistance before assuming it's included in your policy.

-   According to [a AAA study](https://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/), the average cost of a single roadside assistance event ranges from \$50 to \$200, depending on the service required and whether or not it's covered by your insurance policy or membership.

## 11. "Pay-per-mile insurance means you only pay for the miles you drive!"

### The truth: Base rates and potential fees still apply

While pay-per-mile insurance can be a cost-effective option for low-mileage drivers, it's important to understand that a base rate is still charged, regardless of how many miles you drive. 

Additionally, some providers may charge fees for canceling the policy or exceeding a certain number of miles per day. 

Be sure to read the fine print and calculate your potential costs before choosing this type of coverage.

-   A study by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/UBI%20Consumer%20Shopping%20Tool.pdf) found that pay-per-mile insurance can save drivers who drive fewer than 10,000 miles per year up to 25% on their premiums.

## 12. "Get a multi-car discount with no restrictions!"

### The truth: Eligibility requirements and limitations apply

While multi-car discounts can help save money for households with multiple vehicles, insurers often have specific eligibility requirements and limitations. 

These may include restrictions on the types of vehicles covered or the maximum number of cars that can be insured under one policy. 

Make sure to review the terms and conditions associated with any multi-car discounts offered to ensure you fully understand the savings potential.

-   According to [a study by Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/auto-insurance-special-report/index.htm), bundling auto insurance policies for multiple vehicles can save drivers an average of 11% on their premiums.

## 13. "No referrals needed for specialist visits!"

### The truth: Network restrictions and limitations may apply

While some health insurance plans claim that you don't need a referral to see a specialist, there may still be network restrictions or limitations on the types of specialists you can visit without a referral. 

It's important to review your plan's details to understand any conditions or requirements associated with specialist visits.

-   [A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/report/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey/) found that 23% of large employer-sponsored health plans require a referral to see a specialist.

## 14. "Zero copayments on all preventive care services!"

### The truth: Coverage varies by service and plan

While many health insurance plans offer zero copayments for preventive care services, the specific services covered and the extent of coverage can vary depending on your plan. 

Always review your policy to understand which preventive services are included and any associated costs or limitations.

-   According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db431-H.pdf), 76.6% of privately insured adults aged 18–64 had no out-of-pocket costs for preventive services in 2019.

## 15. "No waiting period for pre-existing conditions!"

### The truth: Waiting periods may still apply in some cases

While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums due to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods may still apply in certain situations, such as short-term health plans or dental and vision insurance. 

Be sure to review the specifics of your policy regarding pre-existing conditions and any applicable waiting periods.

-   [A study by the Commonwealth Fund](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/feb/how-aca-has-improved-ability-to-buy-health-insurance) found that prior to the ACA, 36% of individuals who tried to purchase individual market health insurance were denied coverage, charged a higher premium, or had benefits excluded due to a pre-existing condition.

## 16. "Unlimited prescription drug coverage!"

### The truth: Coverage limits and tiered pricing may apply

While some health insurance plans may advertise unlimited prescription drug coverage, there are often limitations on the types of drugs covered and the associated costs. 

Many plans utilize tiered pricing, which assigns different cost-sharing levels to various medications. 

Make sure to review your plan's formulary and understand any coverage limits or restrictions.

-   According to [a study by the RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2314.html), about 14% of adults with employer-sponsored health insurance had access to a fitness center discount or reimbursement in 2018.

## 17. "No out-of-pocket maximum for medical expenses!"

### The truth: Out-of-pocket maximums typically apply

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most health insurance plans to include an annual out-of-pocket maximum for covered services. 

This means that there is a limit on how much you'll pay each year before your plan starts covering 100% of your expenses. 

Be cautious of any claims stating no out-of-pocket maximums, as this may not be in compliance with the ACA or may only apply to specific services.

-   [A study by the American Hospital Association](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2019-02/fact-sheet-telehealth-0219.pdf) found that 76% of U.S. hospitals connected patients with healthcare providers using video or other technology in 2017.

## 18. "Free gym memberships for all members!"

### The truth: Program eligibility and restrictions may apply

While some health insurance plans offer free or discounted gym memberships as part of their wellness programs, these benefits may be subject to eligibility requirements or limitations. 

Be sure to review your plan's wellness program details to understand any restrictions or conditions associated with gym membership benefits.

-   According to [a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2020-section-9-prescription-drug-benefits/), 77% of people with employer-sponsored health insurance had a tiered cost-sharing structure for prescription drugs in 2020.

## 19. "Telehealth services are always covered!"

### The truth: Coverage varies by plan and provider

Telehealth services have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and accessibility. 

However, coverage for these services can vary depending on your insurance plan and the specific telehealth provider. 

Make sure to review your policy details regarding telehealth coverage before assuming it's included in your plan.

-   [A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2020-section-7-plan-funding-and-out-of-pocket-maximums/) found that in 2020, the average out-of-pocket maximum for an individual enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan was \$4,578.
