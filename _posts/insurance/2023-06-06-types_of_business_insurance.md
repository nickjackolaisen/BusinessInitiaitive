This general outline of the different commercial policies allows you to quickly compare coverage and determine which insurance plans best fit your needs, so you can focus on growing your business without worrying about the risks.

If you run a business, odds are you will use at least one of the policies mentioned in this list. 

####    1.  General Liability Insurance
<p>Business liability insurance provides broad coverage. Protects from claims made against damages caused during business operations. Protects property rented by your business, medical claims and injuries.</p>

<p>Without general liability insurance, it is going to be harder to get clients and grow your business. Protects from claims brought against damages caused to others. Business liability insurance does not cover damages made within your company.</p>

<p>If you own or lease real estate or equipment, Commercial Property Insurance protects your investments from catastrophic events like fires and storms. You should consider this insurance if you run a business from home. Don’t rely on home insurance alone. Business property is not covered by home insurance. </p>

<p>Consider getting separate property insurance for especially valuable property. If renting, you will need renters insurance to protect you from damage caused by tenants.</p>

### Supplementary Insurance Policies

The following insurance plans can only be added to an existing policy:

####    12.	Accounts Receivable Insurance

####    13.	Business Interruption insurance
Business Income insurance, or business interruption insurance, protects your company from losses stemming from temporary closures due to natural disasters and similar events.

####    14.	Business Crime Insurance and Equipment Breakdown Insurance

The goal is to get maximum coverage and protection at a minimal cost to your company. 

In life, it is impossible to **completely** avoid risk. 

Thankfully insurance policies, like those listed, are available to help you further reduce your risk for common situations you may encounter depending on your business model and location.
