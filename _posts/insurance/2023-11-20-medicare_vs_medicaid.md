In the United States, healthcare is a complex and sometimes confusing system. 

Two of the most well-known government-funded healthcare programs are **Medicare** and **Medicaid**.

At first glance, these programs may seem similar, but there are significant differences between them.

## What is Medicare?

Medicare is a federal health insurance program that primarily provides coverage for people aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Established in 1965 under the Social Security Act, Medicare is divided into four parts:

**1.  Part A (Hospital Insurance):** Covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health services.

**2.  Part B (Medical Insurance):** Covers doctor services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive health services.

**3.  Part C (Medicare Advantage):** A private insurance alternative to Parts A and B, offering additional benefits and usually including Part D.
<a id="medicaid"> 

**4.  Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage):** Offered through private insurance companies, this covers outpatient prescription drugs.

To illustrate this concept further, let's say an elderly individual who requires hospitalization for a medical condition would have the cost of their inpatient care covered by Medicare Part A.

## What is Medicaid?

Medicaid is a state and federal partnership program that provides health coverage for low-income Americans, including families with children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities [1]. 

Established in 1965 alongside Medicare, Medicaid is means-tested and eligibility is determined by income and assets. 
<a id="history"> 

Each state administers its own Medicaid program with federal guidelines, which means that eligibility and benefits may vary from state to state.

As an example we could say a low-income family with children would receive comprehensive health coverage through their state's Medicaid program, ensuring access to essential healthcare services.

## The History of Medicare & Medicaid

Medicare and Medicaid were both established in 1965 under the Social Security Act, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. 

At the time, about half of all Americans over 65 did not have health insurance, and many low-income families also lacked access to affordable healthcare.

The original purpose of Medicare was to provide health insurance for older Americans and individuals with disabilities who were unable to work. 

Medicaid, on the other hand, was designed to help low-income families and individuals with medical expenses.

Over time, both programs have evolved to meet changing healthcare needs and demographics. 

In 1972, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to include individuals with long-term disabilities and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

In the following decades, additional changes were made to expand coverage for preventive care services and prescription drugs.

Similarly, Medicaid has undergone numerous changes since its inception. 

In 1986, Congress required states to cover pregnant women and children up to age six; this was later expanded in 1990 to include children up to age 18. 

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 further expanded Medicaid eligibility to include all adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL), although some states have opted out of this expansion.
<a id="differences"> 

Today, Medicare provides health insurance for over 60 million Americans aged 65 and older as well as individuals with disabilities. 

Medicaid covers more than 70 million people in the United States, including low-income families with children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities.

## Key Differences Between Medicare & Medicaid

While both programs provide health coverage, there are several key differences between Medicare and Medicaid:

### 1.  Eligibility 

Medicare is primarily for individuals aged 65 and older or with certain disabilities, while Medicaid is for low-income Americans.

### 2.  Costs 

Medicare beneficiaries may be responsible for premiums, deductibles, and co-payments, while Medicaid often has little to no out-of-pocket costs for eligible individuals.

### 3.  Coverage 

Medicare is divided into four parts (A, B, C, and D), while Medicaid covers a wider range of services, including long-term care and nursing home services.

In 2020, Medicare provided coverage for approximately 62.6 million Americans, while Medicaid provided coverage for approximately 73.6 million Americans [2](https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/medicare-spending-and-financing-fact-sheet/).

### 4.  Spending

Medicare spending was about  $925.8 billion in 2020, while Medicaid spending was about  $613.5 billion in 2019 [3](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical) [4](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/total-medicaid-spending/).

### 5.  Administration 

Medicare is a federal program, while Medicaid is jointly funded and administered by state and federal governments.

### 6.  Beneficiary Access

Studies show Medicaid beneficiaries have lower access to healthcare services than Medicare beneficiaries. 

### 7.  Quality of Care

Medicaid beneficiaries may receive lower quality of care than Medicare beneficiaries. 

### 8.  Health Outcomes
<a id="summary"> 

It is important to note that these findings do not necessarily mean that one program is better than the other overall. 

Rather, they highlight the need for continued efforts to improve access to care and health outcomes for all Americans regardless of their insurance coverage.
