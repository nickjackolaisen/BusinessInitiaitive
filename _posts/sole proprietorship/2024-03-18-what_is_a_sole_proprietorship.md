## What is a Sole Proprietorship?

<center>
<img alt="who is a sole proprietor?" src="/images/content/yes-we-are-open.png" title="What does a sole proprietorship do?" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Here’s the most technical definition of a Sole proprietorship we could find: 

_An unincorporated business with one owner who is fully liable and receives all the profits._

Now that you are familiar with this list of successful sole proprietorship businesses, the rest of this article is a breakdown of the different aspects that make Sole Proprietorships powerfully unique.

A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest business entity you can run because there is no registration process or special tax regulations. 

It’s not a business entity at all.

By being the “sole” provider of all the services, **You** are the business.

You will most likely be acting as an independent contractor or running a small-scale business. 
<a id="registration">

</p>

Businesses like these exist in almost every industry.  

Chances are that whatever you imagine when you think of side hustles can be classified as Sole Proprietorship. 

## Registration

<center>
<img alt="how to register a sole proprietorship" src="/images/content/sign-here.png" title="How to start a sole proprietorship?" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Not only are they simple, but a Sole Proprietorship is also the easiest business to register because there is no registration. 

Sole Proprietorships are not officially recognized or registered with the state. 

The only real barriers to entry for a business like this are the licenses, certifications, permits, and training required by the organizations overseeing the work done in that industry. 

For instance, if you want to be an electrician you can’t be messing around with the wiring in someone’s house without the proper training and experience as an electrician. 

It doesn’t even have to be a technical job either (as seen in the examples). 

A lot of sole proprietorships in our list don’t even require licenses at all.

## Do you need a DBA?

</center>

Once things get moving, you’ll be doing business under your name. Meaning your business’s name will be your legal name. 

If you want a unique, professional-sounding, industry-specific name relevant to your business, you have to file for a DBA (Doing Business As…). 

This is just an alias (fake name) and does not provide any sort of protection for you or your business.

Instead of “Joe Robinson the guy who mows lawns who lives on the other side of town”, you could name your business: “Joe’s Lawn and Landscaping”. 

Call it whatever you want. 

One benefit of DBAs is being able to open a business bank account. 

This is great for keeping your business’s finances separate from your personal finances. 
<a id="taxes"> 

Getting into a habit of this will come in handy should you ever want to upgrade to an LLC.

## Sole Proprietorship Taxes

</center>

Just like everything else in a Sole Proprietorship, the tax process is also very straightforward. 

The profits automatically become personal income because **you** are the business. 

This makes filing taxes easier than most other business entities. 

You simply include your business profits on your regular personal income tax returns. 

The only extra thing you need to do is complete and attach a self-employment form to your tax filings. 

This form is the [1040 SE](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf). 

The SE here stands for Self-Employment Tax. 

This is just a *fancy* name the IRS made when they combined Medicare and Social Security Taxes into one. 

In a regular 9-5 job, the "self-employment taxes" were removed by your boss before the money hit your paycheck. 
<a id="ownership"> 

Now that you’re the boss, you are responsible for paying them. 

As time goes on and your business expands, you should look into the different tax benefits of LLCs and Corporations. 

## Owning a Sole Proprietorship

<center>
<img alt="how to run a sole proprietorship" src="/images/content/small-business.png" title="Who can own a sole proprietorship?" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Since there’s no separation between you and the business, you’re personally responsible for more than the taxes. 

Being that there’s no real business entity in the first place, you’re personally responsible for everything in the business, for better or worse.

This makes operating the business much easier since you don’t have to answer to anybody so long as you’re doing the right thing.

You can hire employees in a Sole Proprietorship by completing special paperwork and acquiring an EIN (Employer Identification Number).
<a id="protection"> 

If you are seriously considering hiring employees, you should look into upgrading to an LLC. 

This may be a better route because LLCs see employees as business expenses (a.k.a. Tax write-offs).

## Protection

<center>

</center>

*All that glitters is not gold.* 

Although Sole Proprietorships are the simplest business, you won’t receive any legal or financial protections from having one. 

This is the biggest downside of operating as a Sole Proprietorship.

<p><b>➤ MORE: </b> <a href="https://www.businessinitiative.org/sole-proprietorship/disadvantages/" target="_blank"> Find out about the other disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships.</a></p>

By having the right certifications, training, licenses, and insurance to conduct your kind of business, this lack of protection shouldn’t be a problem. 

The chances of any legal or financial fallout coming from your business are significantly minimized if what you want to do is known to be inherently low-risk.

If the business you’re thinking of starting naturally carries more risk, you should check out the personal liability protection offered by LLCs.

## Sole Proprietorship vs LLC

Since you’re here checking out at Sole Proprietorships, you’ve probably already heard a bit about Limited Liability companies.

<a id="faqs"> 

The biggest differences between the two come down to the liability and financial protection they offer and the difficulty in setting them up. 

Being the simplest business with no registration or set-up fees, it’s no surprise why professionals and novices alike choose to begin their businesses as Sole Proprietorships.
