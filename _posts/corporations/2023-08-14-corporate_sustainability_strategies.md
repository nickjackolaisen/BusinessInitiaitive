## 13 Sustainability Strategies for Business to Use Today

Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important consideration for businesses around the world. 

As the effects of climate change become more apparent, companies are recognizing the need to take action to reduce their environmental impact and ensure the long-term viability of their operations.

In this section, we will explore 13 sustainability strategies that businesses can implement to become more environmentally responsible and sustainable.

**1.  Conduct a sustainability audit to identify areas where your business can reduce its environmental impact.**

A sustainability audit is a comprehensive review of a business's environmental impact. It involves analyzing the company's energy usage, waste production, and water consumption, among other factors. By conducting a sustainability audit, businesses can identify areas where they can reduce their environmental impact and develop strategies to become more sustainable.

**2.  Implement a recycling program that includes not just paper and plastic, but also hazardous waste like batteries and electronics.**

Implementing a recycling program is an effective way to reduce waste and conserve resources. By recycling paper, plastic, and other materials, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and save money on waste disposal fees. It is also important to recycle hazardous waste like batteries and electronics, which can contain toxic chemicals that can harm the environment if not disposed of properly.

**3.  Encourage employees to turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and consider installing motion-activated lighting systems.**

Encouraging employees to turn off lights and electronics when not in use is a simple but effective way to reduce energy usage and lower utility bills. Installing motion-activated lighting systems can also help reduce energy usage by automatically turning off lights when no one is in the room.

**4.  Use energy-efficient appliances and equipment, such as LED light bulbs and Energy Star-certified computers.**

Using energy-efficient appliances and equipment can significantly reduce energy usage and lower utility bills. LED light bulbs use up to 75% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs, while Energy Star-certified computers use up to 60% less energy than non-certified models.

**5.  Develop a sustainable supply chain by working with suppliers who share your commitment to sustainability.**

Developing a sustainable supply chain involves working with suppliers who share your commitment to sustainability. This can include sourcing materials from environmentally responsible suppliers, reducing waste in the supply chain, and promoting sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.

**6.  Consider alternative transportation options for employees, such as carpooling or public transit subsidies.**

Encouraging alternative transportation options for employees can help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion. This can include offering carpooling incentives, providing public transit subsidies, or promoting biking or walking to work.

**7.  Offer incentives for customers who bring reusable bags or containers to your store or restaurant.**

Offering incentives for customers who bring reusable bags or containers can help reduce waste and promote sustainability. This can include offering discounts or rewards for customers who bring their own bags or containers, or providing reusable bags or containers for purchase.

**8.  Use eco-friendly cleaning products that don't contain harmful chemicals.**

Using eco-friendly cleaning products can help reduce the amount of harmful chemicals released into the environment. This can include using natural cleaning products made from biodegradable ingredients, or using cleaning products that are certified as environmentally friendly.

**9.  Reduce water usage by fixing leaks, installing low-flow toilets and faucets, and using drought-resistant landscaping.**

Reducing water usage is an important part of sustainability. This can include fixing leaks, installing low-flow toilets and faucets, and using drought-resistant landscaping. By reducing water usage, businesses can conserve resources and lower utility bills.

**10. Implement telecommuting policies to reduce the need for employees to commute to work every day.**

Implementing telecommuting policies can help reduce the need for employees to commute to work every day. This can help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, while also providing employees with more flexibility and work-life balance.

**11. Invest in renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines to power your business operations.**

Investing in renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines can help businesses reduce their carbon footprint and lower energy costs. By generating their own renewable energy, businesses can become more self-sufficient and less reliant on traditional energy sources.

**12. Partner with local organizations or nonprofits dedicated to environmental causes, and participate in community events that promote sustainability.**

Partnering with local organizations or nonprofits dedicated to environmental causes can help businesses promote sustainability and make a positive impact in their community. This can include participating in community events, sponsoring environmental initiatives, or donating to environmental causes.

**13. Educate yourself and your employees on the latest sustainability trends and best practices through workshops, webinars, or industry conferences.**

Educating yourself and your employees on the latest sustainability trends and best practices is an important part of promoting sustainability. This can include attending workshops, webinars, or industry conferences, or providing training and resources to employees to help them become more knowledgeable about sustainability.

By implementing these strategies, businesses can reduce their environmental impact while also improving their bottom line through cost savings on utilities and materials.

## Benefits of Running a Sustainable Business

There are several reasons why companies should invest in sustainability initiatives:

**1.  Enhanced reputation:** [Companies with strong sustainability programs](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-cr-responsible-business.pdf) are often viewed more favorably by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders, leading to increased <a href="https://www.businessinitiative.org/business-tips/customer-loyalty/" target="_blank">brand loyalty</a> and market share.

**2.  Cost savings:** [Implementing sustainable practices](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/sustainabledevelopment/brief/sustainable-cost-savings) can result in reduced resource consumption and waste, leading to lower operational costs.

## Developing a Sustainability Strategy

To create an effective sustainability strategy, companies should:

-   **Conduct a materiality assessment:** [Identify the most significant social, environmental, and economic issues](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/gri-standards-toolkit/materiality/) relevant to your company and prioritize them based on their impact and importance to stakeholders.

-   **Set clear goals and targets:** [Establish specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php) goals for addressing the identified issues.

-   **Integrate sustainability into decision-making:** Ensure that [sustainability considerations](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/About-Deloitte/mepovdocuments/mepov8/dtme_mepov8_Integrating_sustainability.pdf) are part of all strategic planning and decision-making processes within the organization.

-   **Allocate resources and establish accountability:** Assign responsibility for [implementing and tracking sustainability initiatives](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/assurance/sustainability/making-sustainability-a-key-responsibility) to specific individuals or teams, and provide them with the necessary resources and support.

-   **Monitor and measure progress:** Develop a system to [track and report on sustainability performance](https://www.sustainabilityconsortium.org/sustainability-roadmap/) against established goals and targets. Regularly review progress, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments.

-   **Engage stakeholders:** Involve internal and external stakeholders in the [sustainability strategy development process](https://www.globalreporting.org/how-to-use-the-gri-standards/) to ensure buy-in and support. Seek feedback from customers, suppliers, employees, investors, and other relevant parties.

-   **Leverage technology:** Explore technology solutions that can help [improve sustainability performance](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/5), such as energy-efficient equipment, renewable energy sources, or green supply chain management systems.

By following these steps and utilizing these resources, your company can develop a comprehensive sustainability strategy that aligns with its values and objectives while also contributing to a better future for all.

## Implementing and Measuring Sustainability Initiatives

Once a sustainability strategy is in place, companies should:

**1.  Develop action plans:** Create [detailed action plans](https://www.bain.com/insights/sustainability-action-plan/) outlining the specific steps, resources, and timelines required to achieve each sustainability goal.

**2.  Monitor progress:** Regularly [track and report progress](https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/sustainability-key-performance-indicators-six-recommendations-for-executives) against targets, using relevant key performance indicators (KPIs).

**3.  Adapt and improve:** Continuously [review and refine sustainability initiatives](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/publications/adapting-your-sustainability-strategy.html) based on progress, stakeholder feedback, and changes in the external environment.

## Communicating Sustainability Efforts to Stakeholders

Transparently communicating sustainability efforts is essential to building trust and credibility with stakeholders. Companies should:

**1.  Develop a sustainability narrative:** [Create a compelling story](https://sustainability.com/our-work/insights/sustainability-narrative/) that conveys the company's sustainability vision, goals, and achievements.

**2.  Leverage multiple communication channels:** Use a mix of channels, such as annual sustainability reports, websites, social media, and press releases, to [reach a wide range of stakeholders](https://www.globalreporting.org/how-to-use-the-gri-standards/communicating-sustainability/).

**3.  Engage in dialogue:** Foster open and constructive dialogue with stakeholders through events, workshops, and surveys, to [gather feedback and demonstrate commitment](https://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/report-view/engaging-stakeholders-on-sustainability) to continuous improvement.
