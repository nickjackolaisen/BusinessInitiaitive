## What is Corporate Philanthropy?

**Definition**: The act of companies donating resources, such as time, money, or products, to support charitable and non-profit organizations. It reflects a company's commitment to social responsibility and its desire to make a positive impact on the community. 

Corporate philanthropy can take many forms, from direct financial contributions to employee volunteer programs and in-kind donations. This can be a powerful tool for businesses to not only give back to their communities but also drive business success.

By aligning philanthropic initiatives with a company's values and goals, they can enhance their brand image, attract and retain customers, improve employee morale and engagement, and even increase profits.

## The Business Case for Philanthropy - Benefits

There are several compelling benefits for businesses to engage in philanthropic activities, including:

-   **Enhanced brand reputation**: Companies that demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility can enjoy a more positive public image. For example, [TOMS Shoes](https://www.toms.com/our-giving/) has built its brand around a "one-for-one" giving model, donating a pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold.

-   **Increased employee engagement and satisfaction**: Employees are more likely to feel proud of and committed to their organization when they see it making positive contributions to society. [A study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-2017-deloitte-volunteer-impact-research.pdf) found that 89% of employees believe companies that sponsor volunteer activities offer a better overall working environment.

-   **Stronger customer loyalty**: Consumers are increasingly interested in supporting businesses that align with their values and contribute to social causes. A [Cone Communications study](http://www.conecomm.com/2017-cone-communications-csr-study-pdf) found that 87% of consumers would purchase a product based on the company's advocacy for an issue they care about.

-   **Potential tax benefits**: Depending on the jurisdiction, businesses may be eligible for tax deductions or credits for charitable contributions.

-   **Increased innovation**: Engaging in philanthropic activities can drive innovation by encouraging employees to think creatively and come up with new ways to solve social problems. This can lead to new products, services, or processes that benefit both the company and society.

-   **Improved public relations**: By partnering with reputable non-profit organizations, businesses can generate positive media coverage and improve their relationships with key stakeholders, including customers, investors, and government officials.

-   **Attracting top talent**: Younger generations of workers are increasingly interested in working for companies that prioritize social responsibility. A [survey by Cone Communications](http://www.conecomm.com/news-blog/2016-cone-communications-millennial-employee-engagement-study) found that 64% of millennials consider a company's social and environmental commitments when deciding where to work.

-   **Networking opportunities**: Participating in philanthropic events or initiatives can provide valuable networking opportunities for businesses to connect with other like-minded individuals or organizations in their industry.

-   **Greater sense of purpose**: Engaging in philanthropy can provide businesses with a greater sense of purpose beyond simply making a profit. By contributing to society in meaningful ways, businesses can create a positive impact on the world while also improving their bottom line.

## Measuring the Impact of Philanthropy

To understand the effectiveness of your corporate philanthropy, it's essential to measure the impact of your efforts. Consider the following methods:

-   ###   Track financial contributions:

It is important to keep track of the direct monetary support provided to charitable organizations. This can be done by creating a spreadsheet or using a software program to record the amount donated, the date of the donation, and the name of the organization.

Benefits of tracking financial contributions include being able to see the total amount donated over time, being able to claim tax deductions for charitable donations, and being able to identify areas where more support may be needed.

-   ###   Measure employee engagement:

Assessing the number of employees participating in volunteer programs or other philanthropic activities, and gathering feedback on their experiences can help measure employee engagement. This can be done by creating surveys or feedback forms for employees to fill out.

Benefits of measuring employee engagement include increased employee morale and job satisfaction, improved team building and collaboration, and a positive impact on the company's reputation.

-   ###   Evaluate community impact:

Working with charitable partners to understand the outcomes of your support, such as the number of people served or the tangible improvements in their lives, can help evaluate community impact. This can be done by requesting regular reports from the charitable organizations you support, or by conducting your own surveys or assessments.

Benefits of evaluating community impact include being able to see the positive effects of your philanthropic efforts, being able to identify areas where more support may be needed, and being able to communicate the impact of your efforts to stakeholders.

-   ###   Assess business benefits:

Analyzing the impact of your philanthropic efforts on your company's reputation, customer loyalty, and employee satisfaction can help assess business benefits. This can be done by conducting surveys or focus groups with customers and employees, or by analyzing sales and marketing data.

Benefits of assessing business benefits include increased customer loyalty and brand recognition, improved employee retention and recruitment, and a positive impact on the company's bottom line.
