Let's get after it...

## What is Reputation Management?

**Definition:** "Reputation management is the process of monitoring and influencing how your brand is perceived by others."

As noted by Forbes, **"reputation management is about building trust"** ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/04/06/what-is-reputation-management-and-how-can-it-improve-your-business/?sh=5c8f6b7e1d6d)). It involves actively managing both positive and negative feedback to ensure that your company's image remains favorable.

In today's digital age, reputation management has become more important than ever before. Online reviews and social media posts can spread like wildfire, potentially causing irreparable harm to a company's reputation if not managed properly. Therefore, it's crucial for companies to have a solid reputation management strategy in place.

According to Entrepreneur, **"reputation management is not just about damage control; it’s about creating and maintaining a positive image for your brand"** ([source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283832)).

By proactively building a positive online presence through social media engagement, content marketing, and other tactics, companies can enhance their reputations and build trust with their audience.

Overall, reputation management involves being proactive in managing your brand's image and addressing any negative feedback in a timely manner. By doing so, you can protect your company's reputation and ensure long-term success.

## The Impact of Reputation on Business Success

**A company's reputation is one of its most valuable assets.** 

It affects every aspect of the business, from customer acquisition and retention to employee morale and investor confidence. A negative reputation can harm a company's bottom line, while a positive reputation can help it thrive.

For example, in 2017, United Airlines faced a public relations crisis when a passenger was forcibly removed from a flight. The incident was captured on video and quickly went viral, leading to a public outcry and a significant drop in United's stock price. The incident damaged United's reputation and cost the company millions of dollars in lost revenue.

There have been hundreds, if not, thousands of incidents just like this. People and companies are getting cancelled, demonetized, censored, and banned every day.

On the other hand, companies with strong reputations, such as Apple and Google, benefit from positive word-of-mouth marketing, which can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty.

## Assessing and Monitoring Your Company's Reputation

The first step in managing your company's reputation is to assess its current state. This involves monitoring online reviews, social media mentions, and other forms of feedback to get a sense of how your company is perceived by the public.

There are several tools and services available to help you monitor your company's reputation. For example, [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) can be set up to notify you whenever your company is mentioned online. Social media monitoring tools like [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) and [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/) can help you track mentions on social media platforms.

Here are a few more helpful tools you can use to track your corporation's reputation:

-   [Mention](https://mention.com/en/): This tool monitors your brand mentions on social media platforms, blogs, forums, and news sites in real-time.
-   [Reputology](https://www.reputology.com/): It specializes in monitoring online reviews across various platforms such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, Google My Business, and more.
-   [Brand24](https://brand24.com/): Get instant access to mentions about your brand across the web including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
-   [Reputation.com](https://reputation.com/): It offers a comprehensive suite of services for managing online reputation including review management services.

By utilizing these tools and resources, companies can stay on top of their online presence and take proactive measures to safeguard their reputation.

It's also important to monitor your company's reputation among current and former employees. Sites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) allow employees to leave anonymous reviews of their employers, which can provide valuable insights into the company's culture and management practices.

## Addressing Reputation Issues and Negative Publicity

No matter how carefully you manage your company's reputation, negative publicity can still occur. When this happens, it's important to **address the issue quickly and transparently**.

One example of a company that handled negative publicity well is Domino's Pizza. In 2009, two employees posted a video online showing them doing unsanitary things to the food. The video went viral, and Domino's was faced with a public relations nightmare.

However, rather than ignoring the issue or denying responsibility, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle took swift action. He posted a video response on YouTube, apologizing for the incident and outlining the steps the company was taking to address the issue. This response helped to restore customer confidence in the company.

## Proactively Enhancing Your Corporate Image

While addressing negative publicity is important, it's even better to proactively build a positive corporate image. This involves creating a strong brand identity, engaging with customers and employees, and giving back to the community.

One example of a company that has successfully built a positive corporate image is Patagonia. The outdoor clothing company has a strong commitment to sustainability and social responsibility, which has helped to build brand loyalty among environmentally conscious consumers.

To build a positive corporate image, it's important to focus on your company's values and mission. This can involve creating a mission statement, developing a brand identity, and engaging in philanthropic activities. By doing so, you can build a strong connection with your customers and employees, which can lead to long-term success.

## Investing in Reputation Management for Long-Term Success

Managing your company's reputation requires ongoing effort and investment. This can involve hiring a reputation management firm, investing in social media monitoring tools, and engaging in proactive brand-building activities.

While the upfront cost of reputation management may seem high, the long-term benefits can far outweigh the cost. By protecting and enhancing your company's image, you can build trust with customers, attract top talent, and ultimately achieve long-term business success.

## In Summary...

In today's digital age, corporate reputation management is more important than ever. A strong reputation can help you build trust with customers, attract new customers, and ultimately achieve long-term business success.

By assessing and monitoring your company's reputation, addressing negative publicity, and proactively building a positive corporate image, you can protect and enhance your company's image for the long term.

Don't leave your corporation's reputation to chance.
