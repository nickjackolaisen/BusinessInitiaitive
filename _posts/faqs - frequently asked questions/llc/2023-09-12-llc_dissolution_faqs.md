## **Assets, Liabilities, and Financial Responsibilities**

### What happens to the assets and liabilities of a dissolved LLC?

Short and brief answer: Assets are distributed among members, and liabilities are settled before dissolution.

<details>
<summary>Learn More...</summary>
<br>
<p>When an LLC is dissolved, its assets must be distributed among the members according to the operating agreement or state laws. 
</p>
<p>Before distributing assets, all outstanding liabilities, including taxes and debts, must be settled. 
</p>
<p>If there are insufficient assets to cover the liabilities, members may be required to contribute additional funds to cover the shortfall, depending on the terms of the operating agreement and state laws. 
</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2019/20191211-ced-profile-employer-firms-report.pdf">2018 Small Business Credit Survey</a>, 64% of employer firms had outstanding debt; such debts need to be addressed during the dissolution process.

Distribute remaining assets according to the operating agreement or state laws.

<details>
<summary>Learn More...</summary>

<p>After settling all outstanding liabilities, including taxes and debts, you can distribute the remaining assets of the LLC among its members. 
</p>
<p>The distribution should follow the guidelines outlined in your operating agreement, which may specify the allocation percentages for each member. 
</p>
<p>If your operating agreement does not provide guidance on asset distribution, follow the applicable state laws governing LLC asset distribution, which usually require assets to be distributed based on each member's ownership interest in the company.
</p>
</details>

### What are the steps to liquidate an LLC's assets before dissolution?

Inventory assets, determine fair market value, sell or distribute assets, and document transactions.

<details>
<summary>Learn More...</summary>
<br>
<p>To liquidate an LLC's assets before dissolution, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><b>Inventory all assets:</b> Create a comprehensive list of the LLC's assets, including physical property, intellectual property, and financial assets.</li>

    <li><b>Sell or distribute assets:</b> Sell the assets as needed to settle outstanding liabilities or distribute them among LLC members according to the operating agreement or state laws.</li>
    <li><b>Document transactions:</b> Keep records of all asset sales or distributions, including transaction dates, amounts, and parties involved.</li>

<p>Consult with an attorney or accountant experienced in business dissolution to ensure proper handling of asset liquidation.

### What are the tax implications of dissolving an LLC?

Dissolving an LLC may involve tax obligations, including final tax returns, capital gains or losses, and potential cancellation of debt income.

    <li><b>Capital gains or losses:</b> Members may be subject to capital gains or losses when assets are distributed. The difference between the asset's basis (usually its original cost) and its fair market value at the time of distribution may result in a taxable gain or deductible loss.</li>
    <li><b>Cancellation of debt income:</b> If the LLC settles its debts for less than the full amount owed, the forgiven debt may be considered taxable income for the members.</li>
</ul>
