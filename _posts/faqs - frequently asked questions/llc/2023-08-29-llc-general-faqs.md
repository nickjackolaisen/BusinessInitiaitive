<br>

<b>i. Definition and Overview</b>
<p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business structure that combines elements of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. It offers limited liability protection for its owners (called "members"), pass-through taxation, and flexible management options. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc">IRS - Limited Liability Company</a>
</p>

<b>ii. Formation Process</b>
<p>To form an LLC, one must file Articles of Organization with the appropriate state agency, pay filing fees, and create an operating agreement outlining the rules governing the company's operations. Some states also require annual reports or fees to maintain the LLC's status. <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure#section-header-7">Forming an LLC</a>
</p>

<b>iii. Taxation Aspects</b>
<p>By default, single-member LLCs are taxed as sole proprietorships and multi-member LLCs as partnerships by the IRS.

To maintain limited liability protection, ensure your LLC follows all state regulations, keeps accurate records, maintains a separate bank account for business transactions, and avoids commingling personal and business finances.

In the case of <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2018/a150235.html">Alphabet Energy Inc. v.
