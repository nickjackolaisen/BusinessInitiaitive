## What is a Business Model?

In simple terms, a business model defines how a company creates, delivers, and captures value.

It defines how a company plans to generate revenue and outlines the key components of its strategy, including the target customer, the value proposition, and the revenue streams.

Essentially, a business model explains how a company plans to make money.

According to recent research by [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2019/05/the-business-models-that-capture-value), companies with strong business models are more likely to outperform their competitors in terms of profitability and growth.

This is because a solid business model helps companies focus their resources on the areas that will generate the most revenue and lead to long-term success.

### E-Business Model vs. Business Model: What's the Difference?

While the terms "business model" and "e-business model" are often used interchangeably, there are some key differences between the two.

An e-business model specifically refers to the way in which an online business creates, delivers, and captures value.

This can include everything from online advertising to e-commerce sales.

While e-business models share many similarities with traditional business models, there are some unique challenges that come with operating in the online space.

For example, online businesses may need to invest heavily in marketing or website development in order to attract customers.

### The Business Model Canvas

One tool that has become increasingly popular for defining your ideal business model is the **Business Model Canvas**.

Developed by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur in their book "[Business Model Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers/dp/0470876417)," the canvas provides a visual framework for outlining all of the key components of a business model.

The canvas consists of nine building blocks:

1.  Customer segments,

2.  Value proposition,

3.  Channels,

4.  Customer Relationships,

5.  Revenue Streams,

6.  Key Resources,

7.  Key Activities,

8.  Key Partnerships,

9.  and Cost Structure.

By filling in each of these blocks, companies can create a comprehensive overview of their business model and identify areas for further improvement.

So...

Take some time and develop a strong business model - it could be the key to unlocking your company's full potential in today's competitive landscape.

## <a href="/business-model/choosing-the-best-business-model/" target="_blank">Business Models</a>

When it comes to developing a business model, there are several different types to choose from. 

Some of the most common include:

### 1. Subscription-based

A subscription-based business model charges customers a recurring fee for access to a product or service. 

This model is popular for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, media companies, and other businesses that offer ongoing services.

According to a report by [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com), the subscription economy has grown by more than 350% in the past seven years. 

As of 2020, the average US household subscribes to three streaming services and spends over $900 annually on subscriptions.

### 2. Freemium

The freemium business model offers a basic version of a product or service for free, while charging for premium features or additional services. 

This model is popular for mobile apps, gaming companies, and other businesses that rely on a large user base.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/05/19/what-is-freemium-and-why-does-it-work/?sh=32f59d6b5bf3), the freemium model is used by more than 50% of the top-grossing apps in Apple's App Store.

### 3. E-commerce

The e-commerce business model involves selling products directly to consumers through an online store. 

This model is popular for retail businesses, but can also be used for other types of businesses that sell physical goods.

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/), global e-commerce sales are projected to reach $6.54 trillion by 2022.

### 4. Marketplace

The marketplace business model brings buyers and sellers together on a single platform, taking a commission on each transaction. 

This model is popular for peer-to-peer marketplaces, such as Airbnb and Uber.
<a id="monetization"> 

As reported by [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-revenue-growth-2019-11), Airbnb's revenue was $3.4 billion in 2019, with a net income of $219 million.

## <a href="/business-model/monetization/" target="_blank">Monetization</a>

Once you have chosen a business model, the next step is to figure out how to monetize your product or service. 

There are several different monetization strategies to consider, including:

### 1. Advertising

Advertising involves selling space on your website or platform to advertisers. 

This model is popular for **media companies and other businesses with a large audience**.

According to [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-digital-ad-spending-2020), digital ad spending in the US is projected to reach $455 billion by 2023.

### 2. Transaction fees

Transaction fees involve taking a percentage of each transaction that takes place on your platform. 

This model is popular for **marketplaces and e-commerce businesses**.

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1118060/amazon-third-party-seller-services-revenue/), Amazon's third-party seller services revenue amounted to $80 billion in 2020.

### 3. Subscriptions

Subscriptions involve charging customers a recurring fee for access to a product or service. 

This model is popular for **SaaS companies, media companies, and other businesses that offer ongoing services**.
<a id="scalability"> 

As reported by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/29/the-future-of-e-learning-five-predictions-for-2021-and-beyond/?sh=14a12e784c78), the subscription e-learning market is expected to reach $325 billion by 2025.

## <a href="/business-model/scalability/" target="_blank">Scalability</a>

Another important consideration when developing a business model is scalability. 

Scalability refers to your business's ability to grow and expand over time. 

Key factors that can limit your business's scalability include:
<a id="pivotability"> 

ðŸ”‘ The size of your market

ðŸ”‘ The complexity of your product or service

ðŸ”‘ The resources required to deliver your product or service

## <a href="/business-model/pivoting-in-business/" target="_blank">Ability to Pivot</a>

Finally, it's important to consider your business's ability to pivot. 

A pivot involves changing your business model or strategy in response to changing market conditions or customer needs. 

Key factors that can impact your ability to pivot include:

ðŸ”‘ The flexibility of your business model

ðŸ”‘ The resources required to pivot

ðŸ”‘ The willingness of your team to adapt to change
