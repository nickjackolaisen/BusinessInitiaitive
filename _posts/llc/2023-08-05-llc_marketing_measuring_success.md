Here are the five key performance indicators (KPIs) that you should track to measure the success of your marketing plan:

## 1. Website Traffic

Website traffic is the number of visitors that your website receives over a given period. It is an important KPI because it shows how well your website is performing in attracting visitors.

High traffic is not always a sign of success, but it is an essential metric to track as it provides a good indication of the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.

You can track website traffic using Google Analytics.

## 2. Social Media Engagement

Social media engagement measures how well your social media content is resonating with your audience. It includes metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and followers. Social media engagement is essential because it shows how well your content is connecting with your audience.

High engagement rates indicate that your content is resonating with your audience and that they are more likely to take action.

You can track social media engagement using tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social.

## 3. Email Open and Click-Through Rates

Email open and click-through rates are essential KPIs for email marketing campaigns. They show how well your email campaigns are performing in terms of getting your subscribers to open and engage with your content.

High open and click-through rates indicate that your email campaigns are resonating with your subscribers and that they are more likely to take action.

You can track email open and click-through rates using email marketing platforms like Mailchimp or Constant Contact.

## 4. Conversion Rates

Conversion rates measure how well your marketing efforts are converting leads into customers. It is an essential KPI because it shows how well your marketing campaigns are driving sales or sign-ups.

High conversion rates indicate that your marketing campaigns are effective in converting leads into customers.

You can track conversion rates using Google Analytics or other analytics tools.

## 5. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

Return on ad spend (ROAS) measures the revenue generated from your advertising campaigns compared to the cost of running those campaigns. It is an essential KPI because it shows how well your advertising campaigns are performing in terms of generating revenue.

High ROAS indicates that your advertising campaigns are generating a positive return on investment (ROI).

You can track ROAS using advertising platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads Manager.
