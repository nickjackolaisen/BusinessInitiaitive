## What is a Boomerang Employee?

<center>

</center>

Boomerang employees are exactly what they sound like: workers who leave your company and return later. 

They may have left for a better offer, personal reasons, or to test new opportunities. 

But now, they want to come back. 

Why? 

Maybe they realized the grass isn’t greener elsewhere. 
<a id="reasons"> 

Maybe they missed your company’s culture or realized your growth trajectory is stronger than where they ended up. 

Either way, they already know your business, its values, and your workflows.

## Why Do Employees Boomerang?

<center>
<img alt="Pros and cons of hiring boomerang employees" src="/images/content/employees.png" title="Why boomerang employees are valuable in a slow job market" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

The reasons for coming back are often straightforward:

### Unmet Expectations Elsewhere: 

- Many boomerang employees leave for new opportunities that don’t live up to the promises made. They find that other companies lack the culture, growth, or stability they enjoyed with you.
  
### Personal Growth:

- Employees who leave to gain new skills or take on new challenges may feel they’ve grown professionally and want to bring their new expertise back to your team.

### Cultural Fit:

- Your company culture can make a lasting impact. Many employees return because they miss the camaraderie, values, or even the sense of purpose they had while working for you.

### Personal Reasons:

- Some employees leave for personal reasons—family matters, health, education, or other life events. Once things settle, they may look to return to the place they know best.
<a id="pros"> 

But just as often, they might come back for less desirable reasons—job security, lack of options, or, worse, they see your company as a safety net. 

This is where the risks come into play, and as a business owner, you need to be able to spot the difference.

## The Benefits of Rehiring Boomerang Employees

<center>
<img alt="What to consider before rehiring a former employee" src="/images/content/consulting.png" title="Boomerang employees and company culture fit" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

For growing businesses, boomerang employees offer clear advantages:

### 1. Quick Integration

Boomerang employees already know the ins and outs of your company. 

They’ve worked with your systems, understand the culture, and know their way around your expectations. 

This means faster onboarding, less training, and quicker productivity. 

Every day saved on training is a day closer to revenue growth.

### 2. Cost-Efficiency

Hiring is expensive. 

Onboarding, training, and ramp-up time can be costly, especially for small and growing businesses. 

Rehiring a former employee slashes those costs. 

They’ve already been trained once, and they likely need far less guidance the second time around. 

Plus, with their prior knowledge, they tend to stay longer—saving you even more in the long run.

### 3. Fresh Perspectives

Don’t assume that a returning employee comes back the same as they left. 

Boomerang employees often bring new skills and ideas. 

Their time away gives them fresh perspectives that can breathe new life into your business. 

They know what works—and what doesn’t—in other environments. 

That can be a huge advantage in keeping your business innovative and competitive.

### 4. Client Relationships

Boomerang employees might bring more than just experience—they could bring clients. 

Their return could lead to reestablishing connections with former customers or even introducing new ones they’ve built relationships with during their time away.

### 5. Reinforced Loyalty

When employees leave and return, they’re making a strong statement: they believe in your business. 
<a id="cons"> 

This level of loyalty can be contagious, improving morale across your team. 

It shows your current employees that the grass isn’t always greener, reinforcing the strengths of your company.

## The Potential Risks of Rehiring Boomerang Employees

<center>
<img alt="Risks of bringing back former employees to your business" src="/images/content/obstacles.png" title="Is rehiring a boomerang employee a smart move?" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

But boomerang employees aren’t always a slam dunk. There are potential risks that business owners must manage:

### 1. Workplace Drama

**Why did they leave?** 

If the departure involved interpersonal conflict, bringing them back might reignite old tensions. 

If those issues haven’t been resolved, it could create unnecessary friction in your team. 

This is especially true if the employee left on bad terms or had issues with a manager or colleague still at the company.

### 2. Overlooking Better Talent

**Familiarity can cloud judgment.** 

Just because you know a former employee doesn’t mean they’re the best person for the role. 

You might be overlooking stronger, fresher talent because it feels easier to rehire someone you know.

### 3. Old Problems, New Setting

**Some people leave because they’re not a fit.**

If those problems weren’t addressed the first time, they might still be there when they return. 

If their departure was due to performance issues or a mismatch with the company culture, there’s a chance those same problems will resurface.

### 4. Short Stays

Boomerang employees may come back only to leave again if the issues that caused them to leave initially aren’t resolved. 
<a id="hiring"> 

**Be wary of employees returning for the wrong reasons** — such as short-term financial gain or a lack of other job options. 

They might not be as committed as they were before.

## Actionable Strategies for Rehiring Boomerang Employees

<center>
<img alt="How to assess the value of rehiring a past employee" src="/images/content/we-are-hiring.png" title="How to handle potential conflicts with boomerang employees" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

If you decide to rehire a former employee, approach it strategically. 

Here’s how you can maximize the potential while minimizing the risks:

### Conduct a Candid Interview

Don’t assume you know everything about why they left or why they want to return.

Ask direct questions about their motivations, expectations, and what they learned during their time away. 

This will give you clarity on whether they are coming back for the right reasons.

### Check for Fit, Again

Re-evaluate them as you would any new hire. 

Assess their fit with the current team. 

Has your company changed since they left? 

Has their personality or work style changed? 

Ensure that your business needs align with their skills and expectations.

### Address Past Issues

If the employee left because of a conflict or performance issue, make sure it’s resolved before rehiring them. 

This could mean having tough conversations to ensure the same issues won’t arise again. 

Rehiring someone without addressing past problems is a recipe for repeated mistakes.

### Clarify Expectations

Set clear expectations from day one. 

If the employee expects a promotion, salary bump, or a new role, make sure it aligns with their value to the business and the position you’re hiring them for. 

Be transparent about what has changed since they left.

### Plan for the Future

Boomerang employees should be rehired with long-term growth in mind. 
<a id="interview-questions"> 

Evaluate their potential for leadership or expanded roles down the line. 

Outline a clear path for their development, ensuring they see a future with your business.

## Interview Questions to Ask Boomerang Employees

<center>
<img alt="Employee retention strategies for rehiring former staff" src="/images/content/interview.jpg" title="Boomerang employees and their impact on team morale" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

**1. What have you learned since you left?**

- *This helps you gauge how the employee has grown and whether their new skills add value.*

The question allows you to understand how the employee has developed since they left, including new skills, experiences, or perspectives they've gained. 

A boomerang employee may have learned valuable lessons from other companies, which could benefit your business. 

This also gives you insight into how they can contribute to your current team, especially if they've gained industry-specific knowledge or leadership skills.

**2. Why do you want to come back now?**

- *You need to understand their motivation for returning to ensure it's genuine and beneficial.*

Understanding their reason for coming back is crucial to determine if they are motivated by career growth, a better cultural fit, or simply because they had a negative experience elsewhere. 

This question can reveal if they are truly excited about your business's growth and direction or if they just need a fallback option. 

It helps you assess whether their return will be long-term and whether their goals align with your company’s needs.

**3. What was the real reason you left the first time?**

- *This reveals if previous issues have been resolved and whether they’re likely to recur.*

It's essential to know the true reason why they left initially, as it might uncover unresolved issues that could resurface if they are rehired. 

This could include conflicts with management, dissatisfaction with the company culture, or unmet career expectations. 

Knowing their reasons allows you to address potential concerns upfront and ensures you're not setting yourself up for repeated problems.

**4. How long do you see yourself staying if rehired?**
   
- *This helps set expectations and determine if they're committed long-term.*

You want to gauge their commitment to your business to avoid re-investing in an employee who may leave again soon. 

This question helps you determine if they see themselves as part of the long-term growth of the company or if they're only returning as a temporary solution. 

It also opens the door for them to discuss their career goals, which can inform your decision about how well they fit into future plans for the company.

**5. What has changed since you were last here?**

- *It reveals whether the employee’s personal or professional situation has evolved to better fit your company.*

This question allows you to assess if the reasons they left or any concerns they had are now resolved, making them a better fit this time around. 

It also reveals whether they've gained new perspectives or skills that make them more capable of handling the demands of the role. 

Understanding what has changed on their end helps you ensure that they are returning for the right reasons and are prepared for a new chapter at your company.

**6. What would make you leave again?**

- *This ensures both sides address any potential concerns or problems that could lead to turnover.*

It's critical to know what factors could drive them to leave again so that you can address any unresolved issues or concerns early on. 

By asking this, you demonstrate that you're willing to engage in a transparent conversation and are committed to making their return a positive experience. 

It also helps you identify any red flags, such as unachievable expectations or persistent problems, that could lead to another departure.

**7. How has your experience elsewhere prepared you for this role?**

- *This helps assess if their outside experience adds value to your business.*

The experience they gained while away should bring fresh insights and skills that benefit your company. 

By asking this, you’ll know if their professional development aligns with your current needs and whether they have something new to contribute. 

It allows you to measure how much their outside work has broadened their capabilities and whether that adds value to your team.

**8. What are your expectations for this role compared to your previous time here?**

- *This clarifies what the employee is looking for in their second stint with the company.*

Expectations can change over time, so it’s essential to understand what they hope to gain from coming back. 

Do they expect a different work environment, promotion, or a new level of responsibility? 

This will give you insight into whether their expectations align with what your company can realistically offer and avoid misunderstandings down the road.

**9. What challenges do you think you might face if rehired?**

- *This helps assess how self-aware and prepared they are for reintegration.*

Knowing how the employee views their potential challenges upon rejoining helps you gauge their self-awareness and readiness for the role. 

This gives you a chance to discuss these challenges openly and provide solutions or reassurances. 
<a id="faqs"> 

It also helps you determine if they are likely to be a good fit with the current team or if further adjustments will be needed.

These questions help you get to the heart of their intentions and allow you to gauge their readiness to return.
