-  The majority of LLCs (64%) have only one member, according to the IRS. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)

The fact that such a large majority of LLCs have only one owner or member suggests that LLCs are often preferred by entrepreneurs and small business owners who prefer to have complete control over their company's operations.

-  About 23% of LLCs have two members. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)

-  Only 13% of LLCs have three or more members. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)
<a id="revenue-employees"> 

The low percentage of LLCs with three or more members suggests that LLCs are not commonly used as a way for groups of individuals to start a business together, but rather as a way for individuals to own and operate a business on their own.

They provide insight into what to expect in terms of revenue and staffing levels.

-  40% of LLCs have less than $50,000 in annual revenue. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)

The data shows that a significant portion of LLCs generate less than $50,000 in annual revenue, suggesting that many LLCs are small businesses or startups. 

-  The average revenue for an LLC is $569,512 per year. (source: [Guidant Financial](https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-trends/))

-  Only 4% of LLCs have more than $1 million in annual revenue. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)

The low percentage of LLCs with more than $1 million in annual revenue highlights the fact that while there are certainly successful LLCs out there, most LLCs are likely to be smaller businesses with more modest revenue streams. 

-  The median number of employees for LLCs is 1. [Source](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc)

-  The average number of employees at an LLC is 4. (source: [Guidant Financial](https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-trends/))

The fact that the median number of employees for LLCs is only one indicates that many LLCs are likely to be solo ventures. 

However, it's worth noting that the average number of employees for LLCs is four, which suggests that while many LLCs may start out as solo ventures, they may eventually expand and hire additional staff.
