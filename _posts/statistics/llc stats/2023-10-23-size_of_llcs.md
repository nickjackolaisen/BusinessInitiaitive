## What is the most common number of owners or members in LLCs?

<center>
<img alt="number of owners in an llc" src="/images/content/future-city-technology.png" title="llc number of employees" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

-  The majority of LLCs (64%) have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">only one member</a>, according to the IRS. 

The fact that such a large majority of LLCs have only one owner or member suggests that LLCs are often preferred by entrepreneurs and small business owners who prefer to have complete control over their company's operations.

-  About 23% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">two members</a>.
<a id="revenue-employees"> 

-  Only 13% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">three or more members</a>.

The low percentage of LLCs with three or more members suggests that LLCs are not commonly used as a way for groups of individuals to start a business together, but rather as a way for individuals to own and operate a business on their own.

## What are the Most Common Sizes of LLCs?

<center>
<img alt="how many employees can an llc have" src="/images/content/funny-workers.png" title="how many employees can you have with an llc" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

These statistics can be useful if you are an entrepreneur or small business owners who is considering forming an LLC. 

They provide insight into what to expect in terms of revenue and staffing levels.

### How much money do LLCs make?

-  40% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">less than $50,000</a> in annual revenue.

The data shows that a significant portion of LLCs generate less than $50,000 in annual revenue, suggesting that many LLCs are small businesses or startups. 

-  The <a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-trends/" target="_blank">average revenue</a> for an LLC is $569,512 per year.

-  Only 4% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">more than $1 million</a> in annual revenue.

The low percentage of LLCs with more than $1 million in annual revenue highlights the fact that while there are certainly successful LLCs out there, most LLCs are likely to be smaller businesses with more modest revenue streams. 

### How many employees do LLCs have?

-  85% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/llc-faqs" target="_blank">no employees</a> other than the owner.

Being that 85% of LLCs have no employees other than the owner suggests that many LLCs are likely to be solo ventures.

-  The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">median number of employees</a> for LLCs is 1.

-  The <a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-trends/" target="_blank">average number of employees</a> at an LLC is 4.

The fact that the median number of employees for LLCs is only one indicates that many LLCs are likely to be solo ventures. 
<a id="small-businesses"> 

However, it's worth noting that the average number of employees for LLCs is four, which suggests that while many LLCs may start out as solo ventures, they may eventually expand and hire additional staff. 

-  Only 12% of LLCs have <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank">more than one employee</a>.

## What Percentage of LLCs are Small Businesses?

The fact that 96% of LLCs are considered small businesses highlights the popularity of this type of business entity among entrepreneurs and small business owners.

-  55% of small businesses are <a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-trends/" target="_blank">home-based</a>, which many LLCs are.

It's worth noting that many home-based businesses are also LLCs, with 55% of small businesses being home-based according to the data we found. 
<a id="growth-strategies"> 

This suggests that LLCs may be particularly well-suited for entrepreneurs who want to start a business from home, as they offer liability protection and flexibility without requiring a physical storefront or office space.

-  LLCs that invest in <a href="https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/04/first-advertising-campaign.html" target="_blank">marketing and advertising</a> have a higher chance of increasing revenue.

-  LLCs that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-crm-small-business/" target="_blank">leverage technology to streamline operations</a> can grow faster than those that don't.
