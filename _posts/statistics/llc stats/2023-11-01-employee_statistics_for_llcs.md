To know how American workers are doing, we need to know what benefits they get. 

Small businesses, like LLCs, often offer benefits to their employees. We can learn a lot about what small businesses need by looking at these benefits.

## Employee Turnover Rates and Costs in LLCs

Employee turnover is a big problem for small businesses like LLCs.
