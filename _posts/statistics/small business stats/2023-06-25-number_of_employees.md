The number of employees at small businesses can vary greatly depending on the industry in which they operate. 

In this article, we will explore the average number of employees at small businesses across different industries.

According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), **a small business has fewer than 500 employees**. 

This definition applies to a wide range of industries, including retail, manufacturing, construction, and professional services.
