## What percentage of small businesses pay taxes?

Small businesses have always been an essential part of the economy, providing employment opportunities and driving innovation. 

However, one critical aspect that often gets overlooked is their contribution to the tax system. 

Small businesses are not exempt from paying taxes, but what percentage of small businesses actually pay taxes?

**According to the IRS, approximately 93% of small businesses file their taxes on time.** 

This percentage includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. 

It's essential to note that filing taxes and paying taxes are two different things.

Not all small businesses that file taxes end up paying taxes. 

The percentage of small businesses that pay taxes is more challenging to calculate accurately.

One study conducted by the National Small Business Association (NSBA) found that **65% of small businesses pay taxes at a rate of 25% or less.** 

The remaining 35% pay taxes at a rate of 26% or higher. The NSBA's study also found that **small businesses pay an average effective tax rate of 19.8%.**

## Which industries do small businesses pay the MOST in taxes?

It's worth noting that the percentage of small businesses that pay taxes varies depending on the industry. 

Some industries have higher average effective tax rates than others.
