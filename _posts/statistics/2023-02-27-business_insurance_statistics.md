You should consider this insurance if you run a business from home. Don’t rely on home insurance alone. Business property is not covered by home insurance. Consider getting separate property insurance for especially valuable property. If renting, you will need renters insurance to protect from damage caused by tenants.

####    3.  Commercial Auto Insurance 
*Company Vehicle Protection*
The protection of commercial auto insurance is limited to company vehicles used on a daily basis.

####    4.  Workers Compensation Insurance 
*Employee Protection*
Consider getting Workers Compensation Insurance if you have employees and you want protection from claims made against damages caused to employees. Many states make workers comp insurance an essential requirement to having employees in the first place.

####    5.  Professional Liability Insurance 
*Protects The Services You Provide*

Commercial Umbrella Insurance gives you extra coverage over incidents not fully insured by the other insurance policies you own.

####    9.  Cyber Liability insurance

####    10. Business Crime Insurance 
*Protection from Criminal Mischief*
Property insurance does not cover damages caused by criminal activity like loses due to fraud and theft. Crime Insurance allows you to get protection for specific crimes which may apply to you.

####    11. Equipment Breakdown Insurance 
*Equipment and Machinery Protection*
It’s important to protect equipment essential to the operation of your business. Equipment Breakdown Insurance can be purchased on its own or used in a bundle to supplement a policy you already have for your company. This insurance covers claims made against damages caused by equipment failure.

### Supplementary Insurance Policies

The following insurance plans can only be added to an existing policy:

####    12.	Accounts Receivable Insurance
If you lose the ability to bill clients due to lost or damage of receipts or other billing data, Accounts Receivable Insurance gives you an added layer of protection and mitigates the financial losses of such an event. 

####    13.	Business Interruption insurance
Business Income insurance, or business interruption insurance, protects your company from losses stemming from temporary closures due to natural disasters and similar events.

####    14.	Business Crime Insurance and Equipment Breakdown Insurance
Although you have the option of getting business crime insurance or equipment breakdown insurance by themselves, you can also choose to use them as add-ons to supplement an existing policy you own.

The goal is to get maximum coverage and protection at a minimal cost to your company. In life it is impossible to completely avoid risk. Thankfully insurance policies, like the ones listed here, are available to help you further reduce your risk for common situations you may encounter depending on your business model and location.

##  5 Facts About Business Insurance Demographics

**1.**	When it comes to [insurance agents in the United States...](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm)
*   81.5% are white, 
*   11.8% are black or African American, 
*   4.1% are asian, 
*   and 16.5% are hispanic or latino. 

**2.**	In 2021, women made up 50% of the 600,000 insurance sales agents in the United States. This is makes the [insurance agent industry](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm) one of the most gender neutral occupations. It’s actually higher than the 46.8% of women who make up the U.S. workforce for all occupations. What’s even crazier is, women account for a whopping 84.7% of all insurance claims and policy processing clerks in the United States. 

**3.**	Younger business owners (aged 18 to 44) are significantly more likely to carry some form of commercial insurance as opposed to business owners 45 years old and older. Based on [the data presented below](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/), young owners are TWICE as likely to carry business insurance.
 
<center>
| Age of Business Owners | Percentage Carrying Business Insurance |
|	18-25           	|	66.7%		|
|	25-34		    	|	71.4		|
|	35-44		    	|	76.8%		|
|	45-54			    |	38.9%		|
|	55 and Up	    	|	33.3%		|
</center>

Dr. Robert Hartwig, co-director of the Risk and Uncertainty Management Center at University of South Carolina’s Darla School of Business, gives two possible reasons why the younger generation is 2x as likely to have business insurance than their elders:

“…Young business owners may be borrowing to start up their business. If so, their mortgage lender will require them to carry commercial property insurance and perhaps other types of  insurance as well.”
“Young business owners—who may have invested the majority (or entirety) of their assets into a new business—understand that a failure to protect their investment with insurance could easily lead to financial ruin.”

**4.**	55.8% of small businesses in the AdvisorSmith survey said they filed an insurance claim in 2020. This is especially interesting considering the fact that [76.2% of businesses said they dealt with an insurable situation](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/) during the same year. 

So what happened to the other 20.4% of business who didn’t file a claim?

Odds are they decided to forgo the paperwork involved in submitting a claim to their insurance provider. By paying claims out of the company’s pocket, some people can end up saving the business money because their premiums won’t increase. It also gets rid of worries about whether or not the insurance police will fully cover the insurable incident. 

**5.**	Compared to their male counterparts, [female business owners](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/) were less likely to file an insurance claim even though men and women share similar rates for carrying Commercial insurance (67.8% and 63.2%, respectively). 

*   40.4% of female business owners who took the survey reported filing a claim in 2020
*   65.6% of the males surveyed said they filed a claim in 2020

Here’s what Dr. Hartwig, had to say about the fact women submit fewer claims than men:

“Insurance pricing is based, fundamentally, on the frequency and severity of claims made by policyholders. Women, in general, tend to exhibit more caution than men—which in turn can lead to fewer claims. For example, women are less likely to file automobile claims.”

##  20 Facts about Business Insurance Claims

Commercial insurance policies, otherwise known as business insurance, protect business owners and the economic structure of the United States from the inherent risk of running a business. 
	
Over 7 million small businesses rely on commercial insurance to allow them to continue operating and protect them in the unfortunate event a business is involved in a costly accident or is damaged by something out of their control. Many businesses have been financially ruined by such incidents.

**1.**	For every 10 small businesses, 4 of them are likely to file a Property or General Liability insurance claim within their first 10 years of operating, based on statistics from [The Hartford.](https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2015/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years/)

**2.**	3 out of 4 small businesses faced a situation in 2020 where they either could have used or did use a [commercial insurance policy](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/). Based on AdvisorSmith’s April 2021 study 76.2% of the 1000 small companies surveyed dealt with circumstances where they would have implemented business insurance. On the other hand, 23.8% of businesses surveyed were fortunate enough to not have to deal with an incident where insurance would have been necessary. 

**3.**	The most common claim small businesses make is burglary and theft, but that’s not the highest -priced claim businesses are likely to make.

**4.**	[Commercial Auto Insurance](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2021%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20and%20Title%20Industry%20Report.pdf) is currently experiencing one of the greatest consecutive price increases month over month for premiums. In fact, it’s been increasing for the past 9 and a half years (38 annual quarters). In 2021 the price increase topped out at 8%. This is lower than the 8.1% average of price increases for all insurance policies in 2021.

**5.**	In quarter 2 of 2022 the change in price of Commercial Insurance in the US [increased by 10%.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1053503/change-commercial-insurance-prices-usa/) This marks 3 and a half consecutive years where the price of Commercial Insurance has increased.

**6.**	The percentage of small businesses using Commercial General Liability insurance (CGL) [dropped from 61% down to 54%](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) between 2014 and 2018. The number of small businesses with Business Owner’s Policies (BOPs) also dropped from 52% to 45% over the same period. This likely due to the fact the price for BOP coverage and CGL plans have increased steadily over the past few years. This has lead to many small businesses to walk away from these options in favor of reducing their insurance spending. Unfortunately, this means more and more small businesses, and their customers, are left completely vulnerable to injury and property damage claims. 

**7.**	Of the various lines of commercial insurance policies, [Workers Compensation is the second largest](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2021%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20and%20Title%20Industry%20Report.pdf) making up 6.2% of total net premiums written in 2021. This comes as no surprise since Workers Comp insurance has seen 8 consecutive years of underwriting profits.  

**8.**	[69% of small businesses in 2014 were covered by Workers’ Compensation insurance.](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) Only four years later, in 2018 only 47% of small business owners held a Workers’ Comp policy. This drop in Workers Comp insurance seems to stem from a greater overall confidence in the Affordable Care Act. At it’s inception the Affordable Care act, many businesses were skeptical at it’s effectiveness and hesitated to rely too heavily on a new law. As the dust settled, we have begun to see more small businesses integrate standardized health insurance coverage into their business model, opting out of classical Workers Compensation policies. 

**9.**	The amount of [Product Liability insurance premiums](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-product-liability) jumped up by 3.5% between 2020 and 2021 from $3.239 Billion to $3.353 Billion. 

**10.**	In 2014, 19% of small businesses purchased [Business Interruption insurance](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) and that amount grew all the way to 28% by 2018.

**11.**	Not only has Business Interruption insurance been on the rise, so has [Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance and Errors and Omissions (E&O) policies.](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2021%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20and%20Title%20Industry%20Report.pdf) D&O insurance increased by 13% in 2021, according to the CIAB. The only Commercial Insurance policy with a greater increase during that year was Umbrella insurance with a growth of 20% 

**12.**	Between 2020 and 2021, spending on [Property and Casualty insurance](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-industry-overview) increased from $652.8 Billion to $715.9 Billion. This is a growth of 8.44%. This is unprecedented especially when you consider that total property/casualty and life/annuity insurance premiums only increased from 51.1% in 2020 to 53.0% by 2021.

**13.**	According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/careers-in-insurance), the total number of insurance brokers and insurance sales agents will increase 9% by 2024.

####    2.	Do Corporations and LLCs need liability insurance?

The protection offered by Limited Liability Companies and Corporations only covers your personal assets. This includes things like personal accounts, investments, vehicles, and properties. This protection on it’s own does not meet the company insurance requirements set by state governments. As a matter of fact, personal liability protection usually doesn’t even protect your personal property and assets in cases of malpractice and negligence or where the Corporate Veil has been pierced. When it comes to Corporations and LLCs, the business is legally viewed as a separate entity from yourself and your personal assets. Unfortunately, the Shareholders and Members of Corporations and LLCs, respectively, can do things which can destroy this separation and void all the personal protection that comes with it. Lawyers and attorneys have been known to find unique loopholes and special circumstances where the corporate veil can be pierced even when company owners have seemingly followed the rules and regulations of LLCs and Corporations. All this is to say personal limited liability protection is not universal and there are many times when it simply doesn’t protect you or your company. Without the right insurance policy or bundle, you risk losing your business and your personal assets.  

####    3.	Does my business need insurance?

Without commercial insurance you are putting yourself and your business at risk. Accidents, emergencies, theft, and lawsuits can wreak havoc on your business’s finances. If your business is unable to pay out of its own accounts, you might end up having to pay out of your personal savings and investments.

Depending on the product or service your business provides, you might be required to have certain insurance policies where applicable. Let’s say you have employees, your state most likely requires you to have a Workers’ Compensation insurance policy. Some insurance is needed to receive licenses, certifications or permits for your business. Some real estate firms require their tenants to pick up special insurance. There are also international product and raw material suppliers require you to own insurance if you want to buy through them.

####    4.	Is Workers’ Compensation insurance important for my business?

Simply put, if your company has employees on payroll you needs workers’ compensation insurance. In the event someone on your staff gets injured and the company doesn’t have workers comp they can easily sue the company to pay for their medical bills, rehabilitation, missed wages they would have received, and more. It’s important to speak with legal professionals and your state insurance commissioner because the laws, administrative bodies, and structure for making claims surrounding workers comp insurance vary by the state.

####    5.	What if business insurance is too expensive?

40% of small businesses remain uninsured in order to save money. In reality, insurance can save you a lot more money in the long run than if you forego paying annual insurance premiums. Without insurance, all it takes is one bad accident or some natural disaster to strike and you could lose much more than your business, you could use your personal assets, investments, and savings.
	
If you are strapped for cash, one of the best options you have for insurance is getting a standard or customized insurance bundle. This is what is known as a Business Owner’s Policy or BOP. Combining insurance policies is more affordable than buying the necessary policies separately. There are additional measures you can take to further reduce the cost of insurance for your business. For instance, you can get cheaper premiums by setting up a higher deductible. Just be careful doing something like this because it can be a bit of a double-edged sword. You’ll have you the coverage you need but it also means you’ll pay more out-of-pocket should something bad happen.

####    6.	How do I get the best insurance rates for my business?

It doesn’t matter what you sell, you should implement risk management as a regular practice in your business. Doing this gives you a good look at areas or events where your business is more likely to lose money. If the risk is significant enough you should heavily consider getting insurance coverage in that area. Risk management allows businesses, both large and small, to make sure they aren’t paying for pointless policies while at the same time being covered in the areas you need it most.
	
There are four simple steps to properly evaluate and manage your company’s risk:

**1.	Identify where potential losses may occur.** This incudes cases of theft, employee and customer injuries, fraud, natural disasters, etc.

**2.	Calculate the financial risk of each event should it occur.** How often would something like this happen? How much could this potentially cost your business. 

**3.	Brainstorm ways to prevent these events from happening.** What practices can you put in place to reduce these risks or even eliminate them completely? How much of the potential cost of such events would be covered by the relevant insurance policies?
	
**4.	Based on what you came up with for the previous steps you should now have enough information to start deciding which types of insurance are right for your company.** 
	
The price you pay for coverage is usually based on your claim history. To keep your rates low, you can pay out-of-pocket for inexpensive and infrequent losses and make less unnecessary insurance claims. The more claims your business makes, the more you pay for insurance.
	
Another way to reduce your insurance costs is to look at different insurance providers and the different packages and rates they offer. It is not uncommon to for businesses to change providers every once in a while. If you find a better deal which fits for your situation don’t be afraid to take it. One great method to find the best insurance policy for your needs and budget is to compare bids from multiple insurance companies.

####    7.	What deductibles do I need?

When it comes to business insurance policies the minimum deductible is $250 per incident. The higher the deductible, the lower the cost of your insurance premiums. It’s important to think about what your business does, where it’s located, and the chances of a mishap taking place. Although it depends a lot on your insurance provider, most don’t offer deductible for liability insurance like they do for property insurance. 

####    8.	When should I change my insurance policies?

Operating a business is dynamic in nature so we highly encourage you to reassess your business’s current insurance and your risk at least once a year. It is preferable to do this biannually or even quarterly. You should also make it a point to reassess your company’s insurance needs after significant changes take place. 
	
Regularly reviewing your policies is important for keeping your insurance in check. It’s the only way you’ll know if you are underinsured for your current state of affairs or if you can reduce your coverage in certain areas so you aren’t paying for unnecessary insurance claims.

##  Don't Be Like The Other Companies. 

Unless the industry or state you work in makes commercial insurance mandatory, most business owners will put off buying insurance for their company, sometimes until its too late. 

Make sure you get insurance… BEFORE you need it. 

A proper business provides not only to the customers in the marketplace but also to the community. If a business fails, the consequences may be greater than you can imagine. 

Don’t just think about the financial aspect but you should also take into consideration the emotional, mental, and psychological toll it can take on your family, community, and other businesses which may rely on your goods and services. 
Not all insurance is equal and the same goes for insurers. Some insurance providers cater specifically to the needs of small business and can meet your needs and your budget, while other providers have larger and more expensive policies designed to handle the needs of large scale businesses. 

The best thing you can do right now is brainstorm where your business faces the highest risk. 

The money you spend on insurance premiums may seem like an unnecessary expense when it’s not actively doing anything for your business and it seems like it’s just a dormant money pit. 

However, if a situation arises when you need the insurance coverage, you’ll be glad you made the right decision to protect your assets.
