### 10.

##  5 Facts About Business Insurance Demographics

### 1.	

When it comes to [insurance agents in the United States...](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm)
*   81.5% are white, 
*   11.8% are black or African American, 
*   4.1% are asian, 
*   and 16.5% are hispanic or latino. 

### 2.	

In 2021, women made up 50% of the 600,000 insurance sales agents in the United States. 

This is makes the [insurance agent industry](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm) one of the most gender neutral occupations. 

It’s actually higher than the 46.8% of women who make up the U.S. workforce for all occupations.

### 3.	

Younger business owners (aged 18 to 44) are significantly more likely to carry some form of commercial insurance as opposed to business owners 45 years old and older. 

[The data presented below](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/) shows young owners are TWICE as likely to carry business insurance.

|Age of Business Owners |Percentage Carrying Business Insurance |
|:-----------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|	18-25           	|	66.7%		|
|	25-34		    	|	71.4		|
|	35-44		    	|	76.8%		|
|	45-54			    |	38.9%		|
|	55 and Up	    	|	33.3%		|

Dr. Robert Hartwig, co-director of the Risk and Uncertainty Management Center at University of South Carolina’s Darla School of Business, gives two possible reasons why the younger generation is 2x as likely to have business insurance than their elders:

“…Young business owners may be borrowing to start up their business. If so, their mortgage lender will require them to carry commercial property insurance and perhaps other types of  insurance as well.”

“Young business owners—who may have invested the majority (or entirety) of their assets into a new business—understand that a failure to protect their investment with insurance could easily lead to financial ruin.”

### 4.	

55.8% of small businesses in the AdvisorSmith survey said they filed an insurance claim in 2020. 

This is especially interesting considering the fact that [76.2% of businesses said they dealt with an insurable situation](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/) during the same year. 

So what happened to the other 20.4% of business who didn’t file a claim?

Odds are they decided to forgo the paperwork involved in submitting a claim to their insurance provider. 

By paying claims out of the company’s pocket, some people can end up saving the business money because their premiums won’t increase. 

Paying out of pocket also eliminates worries about whether or not an insurance police will fully cover the insurable incident. 

### 5.	

Compared to their male counterparts, [female business owners](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/) were less likely to file an insurance claim even though men and women share similar rates for carrying Commercial insurance (67.8% and 63.2%, respectively). 

*   40.4% of female business owners who took the survey reported filing a claim in 2020
*   65.6% of the males surveyed said they filed a claim in 2020

Here’s what Dr. Hartwig, had to say about the fact women submit fewer claims than men:

“Insurance pricing is based, fundamentally, on the frequency and severity of claims made by policyholders. Women, in general, tend to exhibit more caution than men—which in turn can lead to fewer claims. For example, women are less likely to file automobile claims.”

##  20 Facts about Business Insurance Claims

Commercial insurance policies, otherwise known as business insurance, protect business owners and the economic structure of the United States from the inherent risk of running a business. 
	
Over 7 million small businesses rely on commercial insurance to allow them to continue operating and protect them in the unfortunate event a business is involved in a costly accident or is damaged by something out of their control. 

Many businesses have been financially ruined by such incidents.

### 1.	

For every 10 small businesses, 4 of them are likely to file a Property or General Liability insurance claim within their first 10 years of operating, based on statistics from [The Hartford.](https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2015/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years/)

### 2.

3 out of 4 small businesses faced a situation in 2020 where they either could have used or did use a [commercial insurance policy](https://advisorsmith.com/data/small-business-claims-statistics/).

On the other hand, 23.8% of businesses surveyed were fortunate enough to not have to deal with an incident where insurance would have been necessary.

In reality, burglary and theft claims averaged $8,000 in damages. 

This may seem like a lot at first glance, but when you compare it to the average reputational harm claim of $50,000 it seems pretty reasonable.

The percentage of small businesses using Commercial General Liability insurance (CGL) [dropped from 61% down to 54%](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) between 2014 and 2018. 

The number of small businesses with Business Owner’s Policies (BOPs) also dropped from 52% to 45% over the same period. 

This likely due to the fact the price for BOP coverage and CGL plans have increased steadily over the past few years. 

This has lead to many small businesses walking away from these plans in favor of reducing their insurance spending. 

Unfortunately, this means more and more small businesses, and their customers, are left completely vulnerable to injury and property damage claims. 

### 7.

Of the various lines of commercial insurance policies, [Workers Compensation is the second largest](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2021%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20and%20Title%20Industry%20Report.pdf) making up 6.2% of total net premiums written in 2021. 

This comes as no surprise since Workers Comp insurance has seen 8 consecutive years of underwriting profits.  

### 8.

[69% of small businesses in 2014 were covered by Workers’ Compensation insurance.](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) 

Only four years later, in 2018 only 47% of small business owners held a Workers’ Comp policy.

This drop in Workers Comp insurance seems to stem from a greater overall confidence in the Affordable Care Act. 

At it’s inception the Affordable Care act, many businesses were skeptical at it’s effectiveness and hesitated to rely too heavily on a new law. 

As the dust settled, we have begun to see more small businesses integrate standardized health insurance coverage into their business model, opting out of classical Workers Compensation policies. 

### 9.

The amount of [Product Liability insurance premiums](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-product-liability) jumped up by 3.5% between 2020 and 2021 from $3.239 Billion to $3.353 Billion. 

### 10.

In 2014, 19% of small businesses purchased [Business Interruption insurance](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-and-what-insurance-us-small-businesses-buy-is-changing/) and that amount grew all the way to 28% by 2018.

### 11.

Not only has Business Interruption insurance been on the rise, so has [Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance and Errors and Omissions (E&O) policies.](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2021%20Annual%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20and%20Title%20Industry%20Report.pdf) 

D&O insurance increased by 13% in 2021, according to the CIAB. 

The only Commercial Insurance policy with a greater increase during that year was Umbrella insurance with a growth of 20% 

### 12.

Between 2020 and 2021, spending on [Property and Casualty insurance](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-industry-overview) increased from $652.8 Billion to $715.9 Billion. 

This is a growth of 8.44%. 

This is unprecedented especially when you consider that total property/casualty and life/annuity insurance premiums only increased from 51.1% in 2020 to 53.0% by 2021.

### 13.

According to the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/careers-in-insurance), the total number of insurance brokers and insurance sales agents will increase 9% by 2024. 

Based on the trends mentioned above, with more and more business owners wanting to protect their assets, it makes sense why the insurance industry as a whole is protected to see a lot of growth in the coming years.

<summary><b>6.	How do I get the best insurance rates for my business?</b></summary>
<br>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you sell, making risk management as a regular practice in your business gives you a good look at areas or events where your business is more likely to lose money. 
</p>
<p>Risk management allows businesses, both large and small, to make sure they aren’t paying for pointless policies while at the same time being covered in the areas you need it most.
</p>
<p>There are four simple steps to properly evaluate and manage your company’s risk:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Identify where potential losses may occur.</b> This incudes cases of theft, employee and customer injuries, fraud, natural disasters, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Calculate the financial risk of each event should it occur.</b> How often would something like this happen? How much could this potentially cost your business. If the risk is significant enough, you should heavily consider getting insurance coverage in that area.</li>
    <li><b>Brainstorm ways to prevent these events from happening.</b> What practices can you put in place to reduce these risks or even eliminate them completely? How much of the potential cost of such events would be covered by the relevant insurance policies?</li>
    <li><b>Based on what you came up with for the previous steps you should now have enough information to start deciding which types of insurance are right for your company.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
The price you pay for coverage is usually based on your claim history. 
</p>
<p>
To keep your rates low, you can pay out-of-pocket for inexpensive and infrequent losses and make less unnecessary insurance claims. 
</p>
<p>
The more claims your business makes, the more you pay for insurance.
</p>
<p>
Another way to reduce your insurance costs is to look at different insurance providers and the different packages and rates they offer. 
</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon  for businesses to change providers every once in a while.
</p>
<p>
One great method to find the best insurance policy for your needs and budget is to compare bids from multiple insurance companies. 
</p>
<p>
If you find a better deal to fits for your situation, don’t be afraid to take it.

<summary><b>7.	What deductibles do I need?</b></summary>
<br>
<p>
The higher the deductible, the lower the cost of your insurance premiums. 
</p>
<p>
The minimum deductible on a business insurance policy is $250 per incident.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to think about what your business does, where it’s located, and the chances of a mishap taking place. 
</p>
<p>
Although it depends a lot on your insurance provider, most don’t offer the same deductibles for liability insurance as they do for property insurance. 
</p>
</details>
<br>



<br>
<details>
<summary><b>8.	When should I change my insurance policies?</b></summary>
<br>
<p>
Operating a business is dynamic in nature so we highly encourage you to reassess your business’s current insurance and your risk at least once a year. 
</p>
<p>
It is preferable to do this biannually or even quarterly. 
</p>
<p>
You should also make it a point to reassess your company’s insurance needs after significant changes take place. 
</p>
<p>
Regularly reviewing your policies is important for keeping your insurance in check. 
</p>
<p>
It’s the only way you’ll know if you are underinsured for your current state of affairs or if you can reduce your coverage in certain areas so you aren’t paying for unnecessary insurance claims.

##  Don't Be Like The Other Companies. 

Unless the industry or state you work in makes commercial insurance mandatory, most business owners will put off buying insurance for their company, sometimes until its too late. 

Make sure you get insurance… **BEFORE** you need it. 

A proper business provides not only to the customers in the marketplace but also to the community. 

If a business fails, the consequences may be greater than you can imagine. 

Don’t just think about the financial aspect but you should also take into consideration the emotional, mental, and psychological toll it can take on your family, community, and other businesses which may rely on your goods and services. 

Not all insurance is equal and the same goes for insurers. 

Some insurance providers cater specifically to the needs of small business and can meet your needs and your budget, while other providers have larger and more expensive policies designed to handle the needs of large scale businesses. 

The best thing you can do right now is brainstorm where your business faces the highest risk. 

The money you spend on insurance premiums may seem like an unnecessary expense when it’s not actively doing anything for your business and it seems like it’s just a dormant money pit. 

However, if a situation arises when you need the insurance coverage, you’ll be glad you made the right decision to protect your assets. 

Speak with your insurance provider and take a look at what options are available. Every business is different. 

Take the Initiative to speak with insurance professionals to come up with the best coverage and deductibles to meet your specific needs.
