## Gender Distribution in Business Structures

According to the <a href="https://ventureneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Final-2019-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf" target="_blank">2019 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report</a>, **women-owned businesses made up 42% of all businesses in the United States in 2019**, equating to **nearly 13 million women-owned businesses**. 

These businesses employed over **9.4 million workers** and generated **$1.9 trillion in revenue**. 

This growth is a testament to the increasing presence of women entrepreneurs in the business landscape.

Recent findings from the Entrepreneurship in the Population (EPOP) Survey provide a more current look at gender distribution in business. 

**Non-Hispanic Black women now own 19% of businesses established since 2020, a significant increase from 2% of businesses established before 1990**, showcasing their growing influence in the entrepreneurial space (<a href="https://epop.norc.org/content/dam/epop/media/publications/pdf/epop2022-brief_us_business_owners_gender_racial_identities.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>). 

Additionally, the EPOP Survey finds that **41% of businesses in the U.S. are minority-owned**, a significantly larger percentage compared to previous estimates (<a href="https://epop.norc.org/content/dam/epop/media/publications/pdf/epop2022-brief_us_business_owners_gender_racial_identities.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).
<a id="ownership"> 

According to the *Women Ownership Statistics 2024* report, **in 2019, women owned over 12.3 million businesses in the United States, employing more than 10.7 million people and generating $2.1 trillion in sales**. 

Of these, **1.2 million were employer firms, generating $1.8 trillion in total sales, while non-employer firms generated $313.6 billion** (<a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Women-Ownership-Statistics-2024.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).

## Factors Influencing Ownership

Several factors contribute to the gender gap in business ownership. 

Some of the most common factors include:

### 1. Access to Capital:

Access to capital remains a key challenge for women entrepreneurs. 

In 2018, **only 2.2% of venture capital funding** went to women-led businesses, compared to nearly 98% for male-led startups, a phenomenon described as the "second glass ceiling" (<a href="https://www.gendereconomy.org/shattering-the-second-glass-ceiling/" target="_blank">source</a>). 

Biases in venture capital and banking persist, with women often being perceived as more risk-averse, leading to fewer funding opportunities.

A <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/women-business-ownership-in-america-on-rise.html" target="_blank">2021 report</a>  by the U.S. Census Bureau found that **women-led startups received just 2.3% of venture capital funding** in 2020, showing little change over 2 years.

This lack of funding can limit the growth potential of women-owned businesses and prevent them from entering high-growth industries. 

Further reinforcing this, the EPOP Survey revealed that **women, particularly minority women, often operate smaller businesses with fewer employees and lower revenue**, limiting their potential to scale (<a href="https://epop.norc.org/content/dam/epop/media/publications/pdf/epop2022-brief_us_business_owners_gender_racial_identities.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).

### 2. Cultural and Societal Expectations:

Social norms and expectations can play a significant role in the decision to start a business. 

Women may face more pressure to prioritize family and caregiving responsibilities, which can make it challenging to dedicate time and energy to entrepreneurship. 

The EPOP Survey showed that **non-Hispanic Black women and Hispanic women, while increasing their presence in business ownership, are still more likely to have smaller businesses or be in specific sectors such as healthcare and social assistance** (<a href="https://epop.norc.org/content/dam/epop/media/publications/pdf/epop2022-brief_us_business_owners_gender_racial_identities.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).

### 3. Mentorship and Networking:

Networking and mentorship opportunities are vital for business success, but women may have limited access to these resources, especially in male-dominated industries. 

Organizations like the <a href="https://www.nawbo.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO)</a> and <a href="https://www.wbenc.org/" target="_blank">Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)</a> offer mentorship, networking, and educational opportunities to help women entrepreneurs overcome these barriers.

## Disparities in Earnings and Business Growth

While the number of women-owned businesses has grown significantly, disparities in earnings and growth remain. 

According to the <a href="https://ventureneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Final-2019-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf" target="_blank">2019 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report</a>, the average revenue for women-owned businesses was **$142,900**, compared to **$474,900** for all privately held businesses. 

This stark disparity highlights the challenges women face in scaling their businesses to the level of their male counterparts.

## Gender Parity in Employment

The lack of gender parity is also evident in employment figures. 

According to the <a href="https://ventureneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Final-2019-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf" target="_blank">2019 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report</a>, women-owned businesses employed **9.4 million workers**, accounting for only **8% of the private-sector workforce**. 

This shows that, while women-owned businesses have a strong presence, their contribution to overall employment is still relatively small compared to their male-owned counterparts (<a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Women-Ownership-Statistics-2024.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).

### Industry Concentration

Women-owned businesses are often concentrated in certain industries. 
<a id="close-the-gap"> 

According to the same report, **16.8% of women-owned businesses** are in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector, compared to **14.3%** for all businesses. 

Women entrepreneurs are also well-represented in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector, with **19.4%** of employees in women-owned businesses working in this field (<a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Women-Ownership-Statistics-2024.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).

## Practical Steps to Bridge the Gender Gap in Your Business

As an entrepreneur or business owner, there are several practical steps you can take to promote inclusivity and bridge the gender gap in your business. 

Here are some ideas:

### 1. Foster a Culture of Inclusivity:

The first step toward creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace is to foster a culture that values and celebrates differences. 

Encourage open communication, listen to feedback, and create opportunities for all employees to participate equally.

### 2. Provide Mentorship and Networking Opportunities:

Mentorship and networking can significantly impact business success by providing valuable guidance and support. 

As a business owner, consider offering mentorship opportunities for women entrepreneurs or sponsoring networking events that prioritize diversity.

### 4. Offer Flexible Work Arrangements:

Offering flexible work arrangements, such as remote work or flexible hours, can help accommodate the needs of employees who may have caregiving responsibilities outside of work.

### 5. Prioritize Diversity in Hiring Practices:

Diversity should be a priority in all aspects of your business, including hiring practices. 
<a id="resources"> 

Consider implementing blind hiring practices or actively seeking out candidates from underrepresented groups.

By taking these practical steps toward inclusivity and diversity, you can help bridge the gender gap in your business and promote a more equitable environment for all employees.
