## Business Structures and Their Impact on Capital Access

There are several types of business structures, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), and corporations. 

Each structure has its own set of advantages and disadvantages when it comes to accessing capital.

### Sole Proprietorships

Sole proprietorships are the simplest business structure, where the owner and the business are considered the same legal entity. While this structure makes it easy to set up and manage a business, it can limit access to capital. 

According to a [2014 report by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs385tot.pdf), **sole proprietorships received only 4.7% of small business loans**. 

This is partly due to the personal liability that sole proprietors face, making lenders hesitant to provide funding.

### Partnerships

Partnerships involve two or more individuals or entities joining forces to run a business. 

This structure offers increased access to capital compared to sole proprietorships, as the financial resources of multiple owners can be pooled. 

However, a [2016 study by the Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2016-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201705.pdf) found that **only 15% of partnerships received bank loans**, indicating that partnerships may still face challenges in obtaining funding.

### Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)

LLCs combine the benefits of partnerships and corporations, offering limited liability for owners while maintaining flexibility in management. 

A [2014 study by the National Small Business Association](http://www.nsba.biz/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Banking-Survey-2014.pdf) found that **38% of small businesses with LLC structures received bank loans**. 

This increased access to capital can be attributed to the reduced risk for lenders, as well as the potential for increased profitability due to tax advantages.

### Corporations

Corporations offer the highest level of access to capital among business structures. 

This is primarily due to the ability to issue stock, which can attract investors and increase the company's overall value. 

According to the [2014 SBA report](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs385tot.pdf), **corporations received 34.4% of small business loans**. Additionally, the limited liability provided by a corporate structure makes them more appealing to lenders.

## Factors Influencing Capital Access

Several factors can influence a business's access to capital, regardless of its structure. 

These include:

### 1.  Creditworthiness: 

A strong credit history can significantly improve a business's chances of securing loans and investments. 

Lenders and investors are more likely to provide funding to businesses that exhibit financial responsibility and a history of repaying debts.

### 2.  Collateral: 

Providing collateral, such as real estate or equipment, can increase a business's access to capital by reducing the risk for lenders and investors.

### 3.  Industry: 

Some industries are considered riskier than others, making it more difficult for businesses within those sectors to secure funding. 

For example, a [2017 study by the Federal Reserve](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2017/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf) found that **businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors were more likely to receive bank loans than those in the retail or service sectors**.

### 4.  Business Size: 

Larger businesses often have increased access to capital, as they are typically considered more stable and less risky than smaller enterprises.

## Industry-Specific Trends

As mentioned earlier, the industry in which a business operates can significantly impact its access to capital. 

Here are some trends observed in various sectors:

- ###  Technology: 

Startups and businesses in the technology sector often have access to venture capital funding, which can be a significant source of capital for these enterprises. 

According to a [2020 report by PwC and CB Insights](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/moneytree-report/moneytree.html), technology companies received **$130 billion in venture capital funding** in 2019.

- ###   Healthcare: 

Healthcare businesses may also benefit from venture capital funding, with the same [2020 PwC and CB Insights report](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/moneytree-report/moneytree.html) indicating that healthcare companies received **$36.5 billion in venture capital investments** in 2019.

- ###   Retail: 

Retail businesses often face challenges in securing funding, as they are generally considered riskier investments. 

The [2017 Federal Reserve study](https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2017/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf) found that only **45% of retail businesses received financing, compared to 63% of manufacturing businesses**.

## Lessons Learned

The structure of your business plays a significant role in determining its access to capital. 

While corporations and LLCs generally have better access to funding than sole proprietorships and partnerships, other factors such as creditworthiness, collateral, industry, and business size also come into play. 

By carefully considering these aspects and choosing the most appropriate structure for your enterprise, you can maximize your chances of securing the capital needed to grow and expand your business.
