## What are the Largest Sole Proprietorships in the world?

Believe it or not, the Largest Sole Proprietorship in the world simply wouldn't exist. 

Unfortunately, Sole Proprietors don’t receive any Limited Personal Liability Protections. This single factor means anybody with a significantly sized Sole Proprietorship would surely upgrade their Business type to a Single-Member LLC or Corporate variation as soon as humanly possible. 

Without any liability protections, any massively successful sole proprietor would be out of their mind to NOT convert their business to one which provides the peace of mind of Limited Personal Liability Protections, the savings of tax breaks, and the option to expand and add Owners and Investors.

## Why are Sole Proprietorships the MOST Popular?

As the simplest business entity to both set up and operate, it is no wonder why so many people opt for Sole Proprietorships as opposed to going through the headache of registering a business with your state. Other, more complicated businesses (LLCs and Corporations)require a lot of upkeep and annual registration fees. 

Honestly, the best part of a Sole Proprietorship is getting out of having to file stacks of paperwork and deal with government bureaucracy.

## What is a major weakness of the Sole Proprietorship?

The main pitfall of starting a Sole Proprietorship is the limitations on what you can and cannot do. 

For instance, it can be extremely difficult to secure funding as an unregistered, unrecognized business. To put it in modern tongue... you don't have any clout while operating as a Sole Proprietor. 

It's also important to consider the amount of liability you take on as a Sole Proprietor. Any debts or liability falls directly on you. Like it out not, you are "solely" responsible for every aspect of your business. Banks can't give you a business loan or business credit cards because, legally speaking, you don't have a business. You are just making money under your name by providing goods and services. There is no entity and no liability protection.
