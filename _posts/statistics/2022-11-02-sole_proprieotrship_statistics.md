## What are the Largest Sole Proprietorships in the world?

Believe it or not, the Largest Sole Proprietorship in the world simply wouldn't exist. 

Unfortunately, Sole Proprietors don’t receive any [Limited Personal Liability Protections](https://www.businessinitiative.org/sole-proprietorship-vs-llc/). This single factor means anybody with a significantly sized Sole Proprietorship would surely upgrade their Business type to a [Single-Member LLC](https://www.businessinitiative.org/what-does-llc-mean/) or Corporate variation as soon as humanly possible. 

Without any liability protections, any massively successful sole proprietor would be out of their mind to NOT convert their business to one which provides the peace of mind of Limited Personal Liability Protections, the savings of tax breaks, and the option to expand and add Owners and Investors.

## Why are Sole Proprietorships the MOST popular business entity?

As the simplest business entity to both set up and operate, it is no wonder why so many people opt for Sole Proprietorships as opposed to going through the headache of registering a business with your state. Other, more complicated businesses (LLCs and Corporations) require a lot of upkeep and annual registration fees. 

Honestly, the best part of a Sole Proprietorship is getting out of having to file stacks of paperwork and deal with government bureaucracy.

## What is a major weakness of the Sole Proprietorship?

The main pitfall of starting a Sole Proprietorship is the limitations on what you can and cannot do. 

For instance, it can be extremely difficult to secure funding as an unregistered, unrecognized business. To put it in modern tongue... you don't have any clout while operating as a Sole Proprietor. 

It's also important to consider the amount of liability you take on as a Sole Proprietor. Any debts or liability falls directly on you. Like it out not, you are "solely" responsible for every aspect of your business. Banks can't give you a business loan or business credit cards because, legally speaking, you don't have a business. You are just making money under your name by providing goods and services. There is no entity and no liability protection.

## How long does a Sole Proprietorship last?

Sole Proprietorships last until one of three events occur…

1.  The owner dies,
2.  The sole proprietor stops providing whatever products or services they sell, 
3.  Or, the owner has the option of selling the components of the business like their tools, inventory, or equipment and is therefore unable to continue business operations.

Being that the Sole Proprietorship is the simplest business entity, it is completely reliant on the owner and their ability to keep their business up and running. As soon as the owner dies or stops doing business, the Sole Proprietorship dissolves. 

What is the richest privately owned company?

Although Sole Proprietorships are known to be better for side-hustles and small, low-risk operations some can get quite big before the owner decides to register it as an LLC or get the stamp of approval from the state and turn it into a Corporation.

With that being said…

**Cargill is the richest privately owned company in America with an annual revenue of $165 Billion, according to their [2022 Annual Report](https://www.cargill.com/doc/1432215917376/2022-cargill-annual-report.pdf). 

Based on their wikipedia page, Cargill brought in a net profit of $4.93 Billion in 2021, after material costs and taxes. Unfortunately, since it is a private company they restrict access to their financial reports.
