There are many leadership styles that can work for small businesses. 

{% include takeaway-box.html bullet1="<b>Shared Leadership in LLCs</b>: Leaders sharing power and valuing learning benefit LLCs by creating flat structures with open communication, fostering a sense of ownership and motivation among employees." bullet2="<b>Democratic Leadership</b>: This style involves more managerial participation in decision-making, leading to increased employee satisfaction, retention, and long-term business success through regular engagement and feedback." bullet3="<b>Transformational Leadership</b>: By inspiring and challenging their teams, transformational leaders foster continuous improvement and innovation, resulting in increased employee performance and higher revenue growth rates for small businesses." bullet4="<b>Laissez-Faire Leadership Pitfalls</b>: While autonomy is important, too much freedom without clear goals or feedback can decrease employee productivity and focus, highlighting the need for balanced leadership approaches in small businesses." bullet5="<b>Servant Leadership Benefits</b>: Focusing on the growth and well-being of employees, servant leadership increases commitment and engagement, cultivating an environment where talent feels empowered and invested in the company's long-term success." %}

Leaders who share power and value learning may have special benefits for LLCs. 

Flatter structures with open communication up and down the ranks help managers stay connected to the work and what employees think. 

Leaders who see themselves as coaches on the team, instead of bosses giving orders, help motivate people and give them a sense of ownership. 

Flexibility to experiment and learn from mistakes is good for nimble companies. 

Regular feedback keeps managers responsible while also giving them chances to help shape strategy. 

With the right supportive, growth-focused approaches, LLCs can empower managers to lead from the front as involved partners driving new ideas, productivity and growth no matter the economic conditions.

## Autocratic Leadership

<center>
<img alt="Autocratic Leadership" src="/images/content/diverse-meeting.png" title="Autocratic leadership meeting" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

While some companies still have bosses that make all the decisions, most small businesses now know it's better to share power with managers. 

-   [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2019/11/24/does-anyone-actually-like-autocratic-leaders-new-data-says-yes/?sh=316126f310de) reports that around 21% of employees view autocratic leaderships in their workplace as a viable option.

When leaders get ideas from different people with different skills, it helps them make better choices. 

It also helps everyone feel more involved if they often talk about goals and values. 

-   The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results) states that autocratic leaders make up approximately 15% of all managers in LLCs.

Over time, if bosses just tell everyone what to do, they may lose top talent who want more say and teamwork in their jobs. 
<a id="democratic"> 

-   A survey by [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/237119/employee-burnout-part-main-causes.aspx) found that 45% of employees working under autocratic leaders experience burnout.

To keep employees excited and creative, small business owners wearing many hats must focus on building trust with managers so they both want the business to succeed.

## Democratic Leadership

<center>
<img alt="Democratic Leadership" src="/images/content/teamwork.png" title="Democratic leadership makes the dream work" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Many companies these days use a democratic style of leadership. 

This means involving managers more in big decisions. 

-   The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results) states that democratic leaders make up approximately 25% of all managers in LLCs.

When leaders ask for ideas from managers and let them help make plans, it encourages people and makes them want to work harder. 

Regular team meetings give everyone a chance to talk about goals and problems. 

Surveys and exit interviews help check that managers feel valued, developed, and invested in the company's future success. 

-   A survey by [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-trends.html) found that companies with democratic leaders have a 21% higher employee retention rate.

Outcomes like happier employees, more innovation, and better business performance show how democratic styles that bring together different views across a company can provide long-term benefits. 

This approach works especially well for small businesses focused on always learning and adapting.

**What are the benefits of democratic leadership in small businesses?**

Democratic leadership can increase employee satisfaction, improve retention rates, and lead to long-term business success.
<a id="transformational"> 

With this type of leadership style, managers involve their team members in decision-making processes, encouraging collaboration and innovation. 

Implementing a democratic leadership style in small businesses can create a positive work environment that fosters employee engagement and drives growth.

## Transformational Leadership

<center>
<img alt="Transformational Leadership" src="/images/content/women-working.png" title="Transformational leadership helps turn employees into leaders" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Transformational leadership has a big impact on companies. 

-   A survey by [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/544/great-managers-revolutionary-insight.aspx) found that companies with transformational leaders have a 26% higher revenue growth rate.

When leaders inspire and challenge managers with meaningful work, they create a culture where people keep learning, trying new things, and improving. 

-   According to a study by [Leadership & Organization Development Journal](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/01437739810210185/full/html), transformational leadership can lead to a 22% increase in employee performance.

Leaders treat teams as partners by being open about goals and progress. 

They also listen to different ideas to make big decisions. 

Regular one-on-one meetings give chances for career advice, credit for contributions, and talks about the future within the company. 

-   The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results) states that transformational leaders make up approximately 30% of all managers in LLCs.

Results show how this leadership style can get the best out of managers through empowerment and shared goals. 

-   [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2021/05/18/influence-your-organizational-culture-through-transformational-leadership/?sh=1d552a997977) reports that 73% of small businesses with transformational leaders achieve long-term success.

This maximizes success, competitive edge, and long-term sustainability - all important for small businesses.

## Laissez-Faire Leadership

<center>
<img alt="Laissez-Faire Leadership" src="/images/content/competition.png" title="Laissez-faire leadership can cause a lot of issues because managers and owners won't know what's happening on the ground level" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

While empowering managers is important for many companies, leaders need to provide direction too. 

-   According to a study by the [Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1348%2F096317906X171145), laissez-faire leadership can lead to a 19% decrease in employee productivity.

If managers are completely on their own without clear goals or feedback, it doesn't help them improve. 

Teams also won't be focused on the same priorities or values. 

Outcomes show that balanced approaches work best. 

-   A survey by [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/237368/manage-prevent-burnout-workforce.aspx) found that employees working under laissez-faire leaders are twice as likely to experience burnout compared to those working under other leadership styles.

In these, leaders trust managers but also provide guidance, support and motivation through regular communication. 
<a id="servant"> 

-   The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results) states that laissez-faire leaders make up approximately 5% of all managers in LLCs.

For small businesses especially, maximizing teamwork, learning and results at every level requires leadership. 

Leaders need to empower talent through mutual trust, openness and commitment to shared success.

## Servant Leadership

<center>
<img alt="Servant Leadership" src="/images/content/high-five-workers.png" title="Servant leadership in business is one of the most effective styles based on the statistics" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

Servant leadership is an effective way for companies to encourage involvement and empowerment from within. 

-   According to a study by the [Journal of Business Ethics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-012-1322-6), servant leadership can increase employee commitment by up to 33%.

By making the needs, growth and well-being of their managers the top priority, servant leaders motivate high performance through building trust and psychological safety. 

-   A survey by [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-growth.aspx) found that companies with servant leaders have a 27% higher employee engagement rate.

They actively ask for feedback and ideas from all levels while also recognizing contributions, sharing credit and advocating for others to grow. 

-   [Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308746) reports that 71% of small businesses with servant leaders achieve long-term success.

Regular one-on-one check-ins allow servant leaders to understand how they can support individuals through challenges as well as dreams beyond their current roles. 

Outcomes show how this influential yet humble approach can maximize potential throughout organizations by cultivating environments where talent feels empowered and invested in the shared vision of long-term success.

-   The [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2000/03/leadership-that-gets-results) states that servant leaders make up approximately 20% of all managers in LLCs.

### Leadership Styles Review

**1. Autocratic Leadership**: 

While effective in certain contexts, autocratic leadership, where decisions are centralized, may not always be conducive to employee satisfaction and retention. 

It's vital for small business leaders to balance authority with employee input to avoid burnout and turnover.

It fosters a positive work environment, increases employee satisfaction, and leads to higher retention rates.

Characterized by inspiring and motivating employees, this style leads to increased performance, revenue growth, and long-term success. 

Small businesses can leverage this to create a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

**4. Laissez-Faire Leadership**: 

While autonomy is important, a lack of direction can decrease productivity and increase burnout. 

Small businesses should aim for a balance between autonomy and guidance.

**5. Servant Leadership**: 

Focusing on the growth and well-being of team members, this approach increases employee commitment and engagement, contributing to the long-term success of a business.
