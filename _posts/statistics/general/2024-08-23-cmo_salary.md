<center>
<img alt="How a CMO impacts revenue growth in a business" src="/images/content/planting-seeds.png" title="CMO salary trends in the United States 2024" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

CMOs play a critical role in driving business revenue, particularly in companies where marketing is a primary growth engine.

Studies show that **<a href="https://thecmo.com/career-development/how-to-become-a-cmo/" target="_blank">companies with a CMO experience 15% higher revenue growth</a>** than those without one. 

In **Fortune 500 companies**, those excelling in both revenue and profitability have **<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-partnership-how-the-ceo-cmo-relationship-can-drive-outsize-growth" target="_blank">60% of their executive committees focused on marketing, customer, or growth roles</a>**. 

Meanwhile, companies that lack these roles tend to underperform in growth and profitability.

When **CEOs prioritize marketing**, companies are twice as likely to achieve over 5% annual growth. 

This effect is especially pronounced in **<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-partnership-how-the-ceo-cmo-relationship-can-drive-outsize-growth" target="_blank">B2C and B2B sectors</a>**, with B2C firms three times more likely, and B2B firms twice as likely, to see such growth.

Despite marketing's critical importance, **<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-partnership-how-the-ceo-cmo-relationship-can-drive-outsize-growth" target="_blank">only 10% of Fortune 250 CEOs</a>** have a marketing background, with most hailing from operations or finance.

The data shows that companies with strong marketing leadership are better positioned for **long-term revenue growth**. 
<a id="future"> 

For example, only **<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-partnership-how-the-ceo-cmo-relationship-can-drive-outsize-growth" target="_blank">10% of S&P 500 companies</a>** have maintained above-GDP growth for over 30 years.

It's clear, CMOs are indispensable to long-term business success, and companies with marketing-focused leadership outperform those without.

## The Impact of Technology & AI on CMO Roles: Opportunities and Challenges

<center>
<img alt="Top responsibilities of a Chief Marketing Officer" src="/images/content/digital-transformation.png" title="How to hire a Chief Marketing Officer for my company" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

As technology rapidly evolves, CMOs are navigating both opportunities and challenges. 

**<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/business-reinvention/cmo.html" target="_blank">90% of CMOs</a>** report difficulty in realizing measurable value from new technologies.

Many CMOs are working to enhance their **MarTech capabilities** (Marketing Technonogy), with **<a href="https://thecmo.com/marketing-strategy/priorities-of-cmos-2024/" target="_blank">37% planning to increase MarTech roles</a>** to close skill gaps. 

However, **<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/business-reinvention/cmo.html" target="_blank">47% cite the cost of adopting new technologies</a>** as a significant barrier.

**Generative AI** is gaining traction, with **<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/executive-leadership-hub/cmo.html" target="_blank">81% of CMOs</a>** expecting to integrate it within the next 12 to 18 months to support business models and personalize marketing efforts at scale.

Yet, **<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/business-reinvention/cmo.html" target="_blank">63% of CMOs</a>** express concern that emerging technologies could disrupt current business models. 

To mitigate this risk, **<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/business-reinvention/cmo.html" target="_blank">54% of CMOs</a>** are increasing customer-focused budgets to boost loyalty in the face of technological shifts.
<a id="challenges"> 

CMOs must balance the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like AI with the challenge of integrating them into existing business strategies. 

Those who successfully navigate these changes will position their companies for sustained success.

## CMO Priorities, Leadership, & Marketing Challenges in 2024

<center>
<img alt="Challenges CMOs face in adopting AI and technology" src="/images/content/marketing.png" title="What skills does a successful CMO need in 2024?" style="width: 63%; height: 63%">
</center>

In 2024, **<a href="https://thecmo.com/marketing-strategy/priorities-of-cmos-2024/" target="_blank">nearly 75% of CMOs</a>** prioritize short-term commercial growth, reflecting the pressure to deliver immediate results in an increasingly competitive landscape. 

While this focus can sometimes come at the expense of long-term strategies, agility is essential for success.

The importance of improving **customer experience** is on the rise, with **<a href="https://thecmo.com/marketing-strategy/priorities-of-cmos-2024/" target="_blank">21% of CMOs</a>** now identifying it as a top priority, up from just **5% last year**. 

Aligning marketing with evolving customer preferences is crucial for long-term loyalty.

**<a href="https://thecmo.com/marketing-strategy/priorities-of-cmos-2024/" target="_blank">22% of CMOs</a>** still struggle with resistance to change and the lack of knowledge necessary to maximize marketing automation tools. 

Building a culture of adaptability and continuous learning is critical for overcoming these barriers.

Finally, many CMOs face challenges in demonstrating the full value of marketing. 
<a id="examples"> 

**<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-power-of-partnership-how-the-ceo-cmo-relationship-can-drive-outsize-growth" target="_blank">CEOs believe marketing metrics are linked to business outcomes less than 60% of the time</a>**, while only **<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/business-reinvention/cmo.html" target="_blank">54% of CMOs</a>** feel their value is fully recognized by decision-makers.

CMOs in the age of information must balance short-term growth targets with longer-term adaptability and prove marketing's direct impact on business success.
