The number of employees at small businesses can vary greatly depending on the industry in which they operate. In this article, we will explore the average number of employees at small businesses across different industries.

According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), a small business has fewer than 500 employees. This definition applies to a wide range of industries, including retail, manufacturing, construction, and professional services.

### Retail

Retail is one of the most common industries for small businesses. In this industry, **the average number of employees is around 10-15**. This amount varies based on the size of the store and the type of retail business. For example, a small boutique may only have a few employees, while a larger department store may have dozens.

**The average number of employees in a manufacturing business is around 20-25.** This number can vary depending on the complexity of the manufacturing process and the size of the company. For example, a small manufacturer of artisanal products may only have a handful of employees, while a larger manufacturer of complex machinery may have hundreds.

### Construction

**The small companies in the construction industry have 5-10 employees on average,** but can vary depending on the size of the construction company and the projects they specialize in.
