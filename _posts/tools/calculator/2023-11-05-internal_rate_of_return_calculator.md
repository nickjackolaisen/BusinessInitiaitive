## What is Internal Rate of Return?

Internal rate of return (IRR) is a financial metric used to estimate the profitability of potential investments.

It is the discount rate at which the net present value (NPV) of an investment's cash flows equals zero. 

In simpler terms, IRR represents the percentage rate earned on each dollar invested for each period it is invested.

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculator

To easily compute the internal rate of return, you can use our simple calculator. 

Just input the initial investment and cash flows for each period, then click "Calculate."

## Why is Internal Rate of Return Important?

IRR is an essential tool for investors looking to evaluate potential investments' profitability and risk. 

It helps investors compare different investment opportunities and determine which one has a higher expected return. 

IRR also considers the time value of money, making it a more accurate measure than other methods that do not account for this factor.

## How to Use IRR Properly

To use IRR effectively, investors must understand its limitations and assumptions. 

For instance, IRR assumes that all cash flows are reinvested at the same rate as the project's internal rate of return. 

It also assumes that cash inflows received in later periods are reinvested immediately at the same rate as earlier periods.

Investors should also be aware that IRR does not account for differences in project size or duration, making it less useful when comparing investments with different timelines or magnitudes.

Despite these limitations, IRR remains a valuable tool for evaluating investment opportunities' profitability and risk. 

By understanding how to use it properly, investors can make informed decisions about where to allocate their capital and maximize their returns.
