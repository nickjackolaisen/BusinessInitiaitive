In the complex world of corporate finance, understanding the balance between debt and equity is crucial for sustaining business growth and financial health. 

The Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E) is a fundamental metric that compares the total liabilities of a company to its shareholder equity. 

It provides a clear view of the company's financial leverage and its ability to cover all debts with shareholder assets in the event of a downturn.

## Importance of Debt-to-Equity Ratio Calculation

The Debt-to-Equity Ratio is essential for evaluating the risk involved with a company’s financial structure. 

A high D/E ratio suggests that a company is funding growth through debt, which can be risky during economic downturns. 

Conversely, a low D/E ratio may indicate that the company is not taking full advantage of financial leverage to fuel growth.

For example, if a company has total liabilities of $200,000 and shareholders' equity of $100,000, the Debt-to-Equity Ratio would be calculated as follows:

<p><b>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</b> = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity = $200,000 / $100,000 = 2.0</p>

This means the company uses $2 of debt for every $1 of equity, indicating a high leverage position which could be risky or beneficial depending on the context.
